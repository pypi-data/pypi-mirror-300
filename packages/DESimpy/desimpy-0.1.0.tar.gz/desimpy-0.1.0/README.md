# DESimPy
Event-driven [discrete event simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation) in Python (DESimPy).

## Overview

DESimPy is an event-driven simulation framework. It also includes a service simulation module.

Processes in DESimPy are defined by methods owned by Python objects inherited from the `Event` abstract base class. These processes can be used to model system-level or component level changes in a modelled system. Such systems might include customers or patients flowing through services, vehicles in traffic, or agents competing in games.

DESimPy implements time-to-event simulation where the next event in a schedule is processed next regardless of the amount of time in the simulated present to that event. This constrasts with "time sweeping" in which a step size is used to increment foreward in time. It is possible to combine time-to-event with time sweeping (see [Palmer & Tian 2021](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Implementing-hybrid-simulations-that-integrate-in-Palmer-Tian/bea73e8d6c828e15290bc4f01c8dd1a4347c46d0)), however this package does not provide any explicit support for that.

## Installation
