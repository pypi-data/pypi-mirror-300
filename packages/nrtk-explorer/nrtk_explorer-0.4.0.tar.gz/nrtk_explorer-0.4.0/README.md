NRTK EXPLORER
=============

NRTK Explorer is a web application for exploring image datasets. It provides
insights of a image dataset in [COCO][3] format and it evaluate image
transformation and perturbation resilience of object recognition DL models. It
is built using [trame][1] by the [kitware][2] team.

Features
--------

- Explore image datasets in COCO format.
- Apply parametrized image degradation (such as blur) to the images.
- Benchmark dataset resilience with a differential PCA|UMAP analysis of the
  embeddings of the images and its transformation.
- Evaluate object detection DL models in both the source images and its
  transformations.
- When possible it will attempt to utilize the user GPU as much as possible to
  speedup its computations.

Usage
----------

Usage example with virtual-env creation

```bash
# Setup python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip

# install application
pip install nrtk-explorer

# get some sample data
git clone https://github.com/vicentebolea/nrtk_explorer_datasets.git

# Run the application on given dataset (908 images)
nrtk-explorer --dataset ./nrtk_explorer_datasets/OIRDS_v1_0/oirds.json
```

Installing
----------

Install it from pypi:

```bash
pip install nrtk-explorer
```

Or, download and install it manually with:

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/Kitware/nrtk-explorer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

Inside the application source code top directory, install it with:

```
pip install -e .
```

Run the application:

```
nrtk-explorer
```

CLI flags and options
---------------------

- `-h|--help` show the help for the command line options, it inherit trame
  command line options and flags.
- `--dataset` specify the directory containing a json file describing a COCO
  image dataset. You can specify multiple directory using a comma `,` as a
  separator. Example usage: `nrtk_explorer --dataset <dataset dir>`. More
  images datasets available at:
