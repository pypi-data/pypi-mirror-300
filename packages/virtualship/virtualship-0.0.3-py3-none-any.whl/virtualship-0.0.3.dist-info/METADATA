<!-- Insert catchy summary -->

VirtualShipParcels is a command line simulator allowing students to plan and conduct a virtual research expedition, receiving measurements as if they were coming from actual oceanographic instruments including:

- ADCP (for currents)
- CTD (for conductivity, and temperature)
- underwater measurements (salinity and temperature)
- surface drifters
- argo float deployments

<!-- TODO: future. Along the way students will encounter difficulties such as: -->

## Installation

For a normal installation do:

```bash
conda create -n ship -c conda-forge virtualship
