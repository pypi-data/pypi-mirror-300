## Features

Ochrepy supports all features of the web API available at the [Ochre API Documentation](https://ochreapi.docs.apiary.io).

## Installation

```bash
pip install ochrepy
```

```bash
py -m pip install ochrepy
```

pip install ochrepy --upgrade
```

## Quick Start

Comprehensive documentation will be provided soon, explaining all available methods and abilities of this package. For the meantime, examples can be found in the examples directory.

To use this package, you will need a client ID and a client secret, which you can obtain through your account manager at Ochre.

### Example with client authentication

#### .env
```
OCHRE_CLIENT_ID=
OCHRE_CLIENT_SECRET=
OCHRE_CLIENT_USERNAME=
```

#### code
```python
import ochrepy
from ochrepy.auth import OchreClientCredentials

op = ochrepy.Ochre(client_credentials_manager=OchreClientCredentials())

results = op.music_tracks.list()
for track in response['results']:
            pprint(track['title'] + ' - ' + track['artist']['name'])
```
Expected result will be the list of tracks found in your account.
```
'Track 1 - Artist 1'
'Track 2 - Artist 2'
'Track 3 - Artist 3'
'Track 4 - Artist 4'
'Track 5 - Artist 5'
'Track 6 - Artist 6'
'Track 7 - Artist 7'
