# Summary

This package can be used to validate GTFS CSV files. It is
focused on GTFS-Pathways and GTFS-Flex files. 

# Installing the Package

1. First, create and activate a virtual environment:  
    python3 -m venv your-folder-name  
    cd your-folder-name  
    source bin/activate  
2. Then install the package from test pypi:  
    python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps tcat-gtfs-csv-validator==0.0.32

    Note you should use version 0.0.31. Info also available here: https://test.pypi.org/project/tcat-gtfs-csv-validator/0.0.32/

3. Install dependencies
    I could not get pip to install dependencies, so:
    1. grab requirements.txt from the github repo: https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/TDEI-gtfs-csv-validator/blob/master/requirements.txt
    2. and use pip to install the requirements in your venv
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

4. Package is now installed.

# Using tcat_gtfs_csv_validator
The primary function in this package is test_release. A GTFS release
is a set of GTFS files. This code will test GTFS-Flex and GTFS-Pathways
releases. 

## Example Use
An example of using the test_release function is provided in the file example_use.py which is included in the release. The code from
this script is below as well.

To use, I suggest:
1. mkdir test_dir
2. cd test_dir
3. copy the code below into a file example_use.py
4. download a pathways release (directory or zip file from the above) from the github repo: https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/TDEI-gtfs-csv-validator/tree/master/tests/test_files/gtfs_pathways/v1.0
5. replace the placedholder with the path to the release you just downloaded
6. python3 example_use.py to run
7. fingers crossed it works!

Note: Sample good and bad GTFS-Pathways and GTFS-Flex files can be found in the project
github repo in tests/test_files. 

### Example code
```python
from tcat_gtfs_csv_validator import gcv_test_release  
from tcat_gtfs_csv_validator import exceptions as gcvex

data_type = 'gtfs_pathways' 
schema_version = 'v1.0' 
path = 'PUT PATH TO ZIP FILE OR DIRECTORY HERE' 

print("simple_test: trying calling test_release")

try:
    gcv_test_release.test_release(data_type, schema_version, path)
except gcvex.GCVError as err:
    print("Test Failed\n")
    print(err)
else: # if no exceptions
    print("Test Succeeded")
```

# Some more details

A GTFS release is a set of GTFS files. This code will test GTFS-Flex and GTFS-Pathways
releases. The tests focus on the flex- and pathways-specific files (for now).

## Using the test_release function

Call the test_release function to test a GTFS release. The GTFS release is expected to be a directory which contains the flex or pathways release files or a zip file containing the release. For pathways, the script expects the release to contain levels, pathways and stops files. For flex, the script expects the release to contain booking_rules, location_groups and stop_times files.

To validate your own release, put the files for the release that you want to validate in a directory or zip file and then use test_release as follows:

Parameters to test_release are:
    data_type = 'gtfs_pathways' or 'gtfs_flex' 
    schema_version = 'v1.0' (for pathways) or 'v2.0' (for flex)
    input_path = path to directory or zip file containing the release 

Test files are provided in the test_files directory which can be used for referece or in testing the script below.

# Testing the script

Tests for the scripts are available in the github repo. There are two primary sets of tests - tests to test flex releases (test_flex.py) and tests to test pathways releases (test_pathways.py). These tests use the files which can be found in the test_files subdirectory of the tests directory. You can run without modification or modify to test different files.

## To use the tests

1. clone from this repo: https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/TDEI-gtfs-csv-validator
2. create and activate a virtual environment
3. install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. then run either test_flex.py or test_pathways.py - they should run without modification - they are a bit finicky about what directory you run them from, but other than that should work - the need to be run from the dir above the tests directory (I believe)
5. To run the unit test cases `python -m unittest tests/test_gcv_test_release.py`

## Code structure
The structure is that the gtfs csv files are read into a sqlite database - the load into
the db does some of the schema checking. The load into the db is followed by running a set of sql
queries which do an additional set of checks.

## Adding tests 

### Adding a new release to be used in testing the scripts

To add a flex or pathways release to be used to test the script (note a release is a set of GTFS files), go to the appropriate directory under test_files and add a directory with the appropriate files. Then edit the appropriate test script to add that directory to the test.

### Adding a new rule to be tested 

To add a new rule to be tested - for example - if you want to add a new pathways or flex requirement, go rules and edit the appropriate file and add a rule name, a message to be printed when the test fails and a sql query for the test. The sql query should be written so that if the sql query returns anything other than 'None' the test will be marked as failing.

### Adding a new type of file to ber tested

If you wish to add a new flex or pathways file type to be tested - the current code tests only the Flex and Pathways-specific files, so tests for other files in the GTFS spec need to be added. To do so, go to the gtfs_flex or gtfs_pathways directory in the schemas directory and add a file describing the new file. Columns you will need are are: FieldName, Type, Required (from GTFS spec), sqliteType. FieldName, Type and Required are to be taken from the GTFS spec, the sqliteType is a string that creates an attribute of the appropriate type in sqllite


# TODOs
The code focuses on the flex- and pathways-specific files (for now).
