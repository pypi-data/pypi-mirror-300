# TODO - stair count is specified as a non null integer, but is optional, left as int

# rules beyond typing rules will be defined as sql queries
# Pathways must be defined exhaustively in a station. 
# If any pathways are defined, it is assumed that all pathways throughout 
# the station are represented. Therefore, the following guidelines apply:
# No dangling locations: If any location within a station has a pathway, 
#      then all locations within that station should have pathways, 
#      except for platforms that have boarding areas 
#      (location_type=4, see guideline below).
# No pathways for a platform with boarding areas: A platform 
#      (location_type=0 or empty) that has boarding areas (location_type=4) 
#      is treated as a parent object, not a point. In such cases, the 
#      platform must not have pathways assigned. All pathways should be 
#      assigned for each of the platform's boarding areas.
# No locked platforms: Each platform (location_type=0 or empty) or boarding 
#      area (location_type=4) must be connected to at least one 
#      entrance/exit (location_type=2) via some chain of pathways. 
#      Stations not allowing a pathway to the outside of the station 
#      from a given platform are rare.
