## 🔧 Installation

### Linux

Install prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y fonts-noto-color-emoji
sudo apt install -y libportaudio2
sudo apt install -y libxcb-cursor0
sudo apt install -y espeak
sudo apt install -y xclip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Running AI Runner

### Linux

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source airunner/bin/activate
```

Run AI Runner

```bash
cd airunner/src/airunner
./main.py
```

---

### Privacy and Security

Although AI Runner v3.0 is built with Huggingface libraries, we have taken
care to strip the application of any telemetry or tracking features.

The main application itself is unable to access the internet, and we are working
towards properly sandboxing certain features to ensure user privacy and security.

---

### Internet access

Only the setup wizard needs access to the internet in order to download the required models.

For more information see the [Darklock](https://github.com/capsize-games/darklock)  and
[Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) libraries.

---

### Disc access

Write access for the transformers library has been disabled, preventing it from creating a huggingface 
cache directory at runtime.

The application itself may still access the disc for reading and writing, however we have restricted
reads and writes to the user provided `airunner` directory (by default this is located at `~/.local/share/airunner`).

All other attempts to access the disc are blocked and logged for your review.

For more information see `src/security/restrict_os_access.py`.

---

### Huggingface Hub

The Huggingface Hub is installed so that Transformers, Diffusers and other Huggingface libraries
will continue to function as expected, however it has been neutered to prevent it from accessing 
the internet.

The security measures taken for this library are as follows

- Prevented from accessing the internet
- Prevented from accessing the disc
- All environment variables set for maximum security
- All telemetry disabled

See [Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) for more information.
