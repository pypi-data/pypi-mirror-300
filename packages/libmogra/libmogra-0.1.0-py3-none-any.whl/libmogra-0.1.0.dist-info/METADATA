# libmogra

A Python Toolbox for Indian (Classical) Music

## The Why

For playing around (understanding, modifying, etc.) with music & audio specifically in the Indian context. Music theory standardization as well as tool development has been done extensively for western music, but other music cultures lag behind. This library will start with small features, but the dream is to have a Photoshop for Indian music.

## The What

This is intended to be a higher-level layer on top of the widely used [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa).
If you must have an acronym, here it is: a LIBrary for the Manipulation, Organization, Generation, and Raag-aware Analysis of music. If that's too much, think of [mogra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasminum_sambac) the flower `:)`
