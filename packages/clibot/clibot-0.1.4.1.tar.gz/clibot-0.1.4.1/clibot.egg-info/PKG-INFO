## Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Compatible with multiple AI providers including Groq, OpenAI, Mistral, and Ollama.
- **Conversation History**: Keeps track of your conversations for easy review.
- **Setup and Configuration**: Streamlined setup process to configure your AI providers.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes asynchronous operations for improved performance.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for a smooth user experience.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust AI model parameters like temperature and max tokens.

## Installation

To install Clibot, run the following command:

```bash
pip install clibot
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use locally hosted open source models which are available for free. To use local models, you will need to run your own LLM backend server such as [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
>
> **❗️Note: Localhosted models require high-end hardware for optimal performance and may not work as expected on lower-end systems.**

### Setup

After installation, run the following command to set up Clibot:

```bash
clibot
```

### Usage

Use Clibot by executing the `clibot` command followed by your query or command. Here are some examples:

- General Queries:

```bash
clibot "How is my system?"
```

- Summarizing multiple files:

```bash
clibot "Summarize" < file1.txt < file2.txt
```

- Creating and saving files:

```bash
clibot 'Write a simple README file' > README.md
```

- Reviewing CPU information:

```bash
lscpu | clibot 'Review my CPU'
```
