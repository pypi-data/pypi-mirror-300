# simple-repository-browser

A web interface to browse and search packages in **any** simple package repository (PEP-503), inspired by PyPI / warehouse.

Built using FastAPI and the [simple-repository](https://github.com/simple-repository/simple-repository) core library.

## Usage

Install from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install simple-repository-browser
```

And run:

```bash
simple-repository-browser
```

(or alternatively ``python -m simple_repository_browser``)

By default, this will use the repository at PyPI (https://pypi.org/simple/). You can point it to a custom
repository by passing the URL to the project list endpoint (the base URL according to PEP-503):

```bash
simple-repository-browser https://my-custom-repository.example.com/foo/simple/
```

## Runtime details

```simple-repository-browser``` exposes a FastAPI application, and it runs the application in a single ``uvicorn`` worker.
Metadata that is computed will be cached in the ``$XDG_CACHE_DIR/simple-repository-browser`` directory. This cache is not
intended to be shared among different repository URLs, and is unlikely to work for multiple ``simple-repository-browser``
versions. There is currently no intelligent cache invalidation for those cases.


## Development

In order to build the ``simple-repository-browser``, first:

```bash
cd javascript
npm install --include=dev
npm run build
cd ..
```

And then the normal installation procedure applies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

The browser can be run with:

```bash
python -m simple_repository_browser
```


## License and Support

This code has been released under the MIT license.
It is an initial prototype which is developed in-house, and _not_ currently openly developed.

It is hoped that the release of this prototype will trigger interest from other parties that have similar needs.
With sufficient collaborative interest there is the potential for the project to be openly
developed, and to power Python package repositories across many domains.

Please get in touch at https://github.com/orgs/simple-repository/discussions to share how
this project may be useful to you. This will help us to gauge the level of interest and
provide valuable insight when deciding whether to commit future resources to the project.
