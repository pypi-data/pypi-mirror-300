  <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`_ unit files. Thanks to
  Matt Melquiond for contributing the systemd exporter.
* ADDED: ``python -m honcho`` now works identically to ``honcho``.
* CHANGED: Dash (``-``) is now an allowed character in process types (thanks to
  Ben Spaulding).
* CHANGED: Honcho no longer opens a new console for every process on Windows.
  Thank you to Benedikt Arnold for contributing the fix.
* CHANGED: Python versions 3.6 through 3.10 are now supported environments.
* CHANGED: Python 3.4 and 3.5 are no longer supported environments.
* FIXED: ``--no-colour`` and ``--no-prefix`` now work whether specified before
  or after the command.
* FIXED: Honcho on Python 3.8 will no longer issue a ``RuntimeWarning`` about
  line buffering not being supported in binary mode.

1.0.1 -- 2017-04-01
-------------------

* FIXED: This release is identical to 1.0.0, but will be GPG-signed and uploaded
  with `twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>` to ensure it has correct
  PyPI metadata.

1.0.0 -- 2017-04-01
-------------------

* ADDED: Automatically suppress colouring when the STDOUT is not a TTY.
* ADDED: Honcho now exposes a HONCHO_PROCESS_NAME environment variable to its
  child processes which contains the name of the process (e.g. ``web.1``,
  ``worker.2``, etc.)
* ADDED: All subcommands now support ``--no-colour`` and ``--no-prefix`` options
  to suppress ANSI coloured output and the logging prefix, respectively.
* CHANGED: The Upstart configuration generated by the Upstart exporter no longer
  creates a log directory to which to send process output, in favour of relying
  on Upstart's built-in job logging support (present since at least Upstart
  1.4).

0.7.1 -- 2016-04-13
-------------------

* FIXED: Honcho now correctly pays attention to the ``-f`` argument when
  provided before a command, fixing a regression introduced in the previous
  version. Thanks to Marc Krull for reporting and fixing.

0.7.0 -- 2016-04-10
-------------------

* ADDED: Honcho can now export to a `runit <http://smarden.org/runit/>`_ service
  directory.

  environment variable.
* ADDED: Python 3.5 is now a supported environment.
* CHANGED: Python 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 are no longer supported environments.
* FIXED: The ``run`` command now correctly parses commands which include the
  ``--`` "end of arguments" separator.
* FIXED: Honcho no longer fails to load ``.env`` files if the Procfile is not in
  the application directory.
* FIXED: ANSI colour codes from running programs can no longer interfere with
  Honcho's output.
* FIXED: Export of environment variables containing special characters no longer
  breaks the Upstart exporter.
* FIXED: The supervisord exporter now correctly escapes the % symbol in commands
  and environment variable values.

0.6.6 -- 2015-03-16
-------------------

* FIXED: Environment variables in ``.env`` files can, once again, contain
  backslash escapes.


0.6.5 -- 2015-03-09
-------------------

* ADDED: Exporter templates can now be overridden by the ``--template-dir``
  option to ``honcho export``.
* CHANGED: Colour output is now supported by default on Windows.
* CHANGED: Base port is no longer required to be a multiple of 1000.
* FIXED: Output is no longer buffered on Python 3.
* FIXED: Environment variables in ``.env`` files can now take any POSIX-valid
  values rather than simple alphanumerics only.

0.6.4 -- 2015-02-08
-------------------

* FIXED: Common arguments (``-f``, ``-d``, etc.) given before the subcommand
  (``start``, ``run``, etc.) are no longer ignored on Python 2.7.9.

0.6.3 -- 2015-02-07
-------------------

* CHANGED: The commandline ``-p/--port`` option now takes precedence over all
  other ways of setting the start port.

0.6.2 -- 2015-02-07
-------------------

  package is installed.

0.6.1 -- 2015-02-07

* CHANGED: Honcho is now release as a universal wheel package (with support for
  Python 2 and 3).

0.6.0 -- 2015-02-07
-------------------

* ADDED: Started keeping a changelog!
* ADDED: A version command: ``honcho version`` will print the current version.
* CHANGED: Supervisor export now executes commands inside a shell (like other
  exporters and honcho itself).
* CHANGED: Supervisor exports now sets PORT environment variable consistently
  with other exporters and the rest of honcho.
* CHANGED: Supervisor export now takes a directory as the location parameter on
  the command line, e.g. ``honcho export supervisord /etc/supervisord.d``, thus
  making the use consistent with other exporters. N.B. This is a
  backwards-incompatible change!
* FIXED: Addressed numerous text encoding bugs.
* FIXED: Honcho exporters can now be used on Python 3.2
* FIXED: Honcho no longer crashes when all processes are made ``--quiet``.
