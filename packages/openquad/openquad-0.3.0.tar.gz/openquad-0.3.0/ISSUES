- implementation of improved Lebedev-Laikov methods via ROSE.
  These are reported to be even more efficient. Additionally, the ROSE procedure might be
  applicable to all Gauss quadratures with octahedral symmetry.

- add S2 Gauss quadratures from Stepan2020.
  These are more efficient than Lebendev and than Graf2013 and have octahedral symmetry

- add S2 Gauss quadratures from Popov2023, available up to degree 30
  These are more efficient than Lebendev and similar to Graf2013 and have icosahedral symmetry
  Additional, this paper provides a table pointing to the "best" quadratures up to degree 79 from
  various sources.
  It also indicates, that quadratures of different symmetry might be available from the same authors.

- make storage of quadratures more efficient by using symmetries.
  E.g., for rules with octahedral symmetry, storing one octant is enough.
  see, e.g. Stepan2020 https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/04/aa37566-20/aa37566-20.html

- implement functionality to rotate quadrature points.
  This would for example be useful for more efficient storage or for more flexibility.
  Would also allow to test robustness of quadratures with respect to random rotations
  more easily.
