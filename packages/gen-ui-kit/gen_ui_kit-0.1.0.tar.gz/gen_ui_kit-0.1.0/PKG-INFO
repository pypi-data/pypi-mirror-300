# Gen-UI-Kit

**Gen-UI-Kit** is a powerful tool designed to generate starter web UI kits based on a simple input: a project idea and its description and by utilizing [**LangChain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and UI Design systems such as [**Cloudscape Design System**](https://cloudscape.design/). It helps developers quickly get started on their projects with a tailored UI kit, ready for customization and enhancement. Developers can use this starter kit to connect to their APIs or backends, speeding up the initial phase of development.

Whether youâ€™re working on a new app idea or looking for a quick way to start a front-end interface, Gen-UI-Kit is here to help!

## Key Features
