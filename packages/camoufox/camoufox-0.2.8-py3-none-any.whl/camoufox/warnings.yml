headless: >-
    Headless mode in Camoufox is not recommended at this time.
    Some WAFs are able to detect headless browsers. The issue is currently being investigated.

navigator: >-
    Manually setting navigator properties is not recommended.
    Device information is automatically generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided `os`.

locale: >-
    Use the `locale` parameter in Camoufox instead of setting the config manually.

header-ua: >-
    Do not set the header.User-Agent manually. Camoufox will generate a User-Agent for you.

viewport: >-
    Manually setting screen & window properties is not recommended.
    Screen dimensions are randomly generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided screen constraints. See here:
    https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/tree/main/pythonlib#browserforge-integration.

custom_fingerprint: >-
    Passing your own fingerprint is not recommended.
    BrowserForge fingerprints are automatically generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided `os` and `screen` constraints.

proxy_without_geoip: >-
    When using a proxy, it is heavily recommended that you pass `geoip=True`.

allow_webgl: >-
    Enabling WebGL can lead to Canvas fingerprinting and detection.
    Camoufox will automatically spoof your vendor and renderer, but it cannot spoof your WebGL fingerprint.
