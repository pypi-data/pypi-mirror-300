# pycorrelation

The goal of this package is to provide programmers with an easy way to define **correlation matrices** in Python.

Obviously, there exists numerous packages online to define an manipulate matrices, but none of those packages actually addresses the simple task of definining correlation matrices &ndash; or more symmertric matrices &ndash; in genreal.

We suggest a simple yet efficient implementation of correlation matrices.
