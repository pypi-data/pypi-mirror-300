# LISA Instrument

Python package package simulating instrumental noises, the propagation of laser
beams, the measurements and the on-board processing.

A somewhat up-to-date description of the underlying physical models can be found
in [Unified model for the LISA measurements and instrument simulations, Jean-Baptiste Bayle and Olaf Hartwig, Phys. Rev. D 107, 083019 (2023)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.083019).

## Usage

### Installation

Use pip to install this package,

```bash
pip install lisainstrument
```

### Run a simulation

You can run a simulation by creating an `Instrument` object and calling
`simulate()`.

```python
from lisainstrument import Instrument

instrument = Instrument()
instrument.simulate()
```

You can parametrize the simulation by setting the desired arguments when
instantiating your instrument, or by using the convenience methods,

```python
instrument = Instrument(aafilter=None, dt=0.25, size=10000)
instrument.disable_all_noises(but='laser')
instrument.disable_dopplers()
instrument.simulate()
```

### Write the results

You can write the results of a simulation to a measurement file (note that
`simulate()` will be called before writing to disk if the simulation has not run
yet),

```python
instrument = Instrument()
instrument.write('my-file.h5')
```

###Â Plot the results

Once the simulation has been run, can use convenience methods to plot all
beatnote frequency offsets, beatnote frequency fluctuations, beatnote total
frequencies, MPRs, or DWS measurements.

```python
instrument.plot_offsets()
instrument.plot_fluctuations()
instrument.plot_totals()
instrument.plot_mprs()
instrument.plot_dws()
```

You can skip a number of samples at the beginning, and save the figures to disk,

```python
instrument.plot_fluctuations(output='my-fluctuations.pdf', skip=500)
```

To plot quantities for all spacecraft or MOSAs, use the `plot()` method,

```python
instrument.isi_carrier_fluctuations.plot(output='my-figure.png', title='ISI Carrier Fluctuations')
```

or use the usual Matplotlib functions with a single timeseries,

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(instrument.t, instrument.isi_carrier_fluctuations['12'])
plt.show()
```

### Report an issue

We use the issue-tracking management system associated with the project provided
by Gitlab. If you want to report a bug or request a feature, open an issue at
<https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/lisa-simulation/instrument/-/issues>. You may also
thumb-up or comment on existing issues.

### Development environment

We strongly recommend to use [Python virtual
environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

To setup the development environment, use the following commands:

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.in2p3.fr:lisa-simulation/instrument.git
cd instrument
python -m venv .
source ./bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Workflow

The project's development workflow is based on the issue-tracking system
provided by Gitlab, as well as peer-reviewed merge requests. This ensures
high-quality standards.

Issues are solved by creating branches and opening merge requests. Only the
assignee of the related issue and merge request can push commits on the branch.
Once all the changes have been pushed, the "draft" specifier on the merge
request is removed, and the merge request is assigned to a reviewer. He can push
new changes to the branch, or request changes to the original author by
re-assigning the merge request to them. When the merge request is accepted, the
branch is merged onto master, deleted, and the associated issue is closed.

### Pylint and unittest

We enforce [PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python
Code)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with Pylint syntax checking,
and correction of the code using the unittest testing framework. Both are
implemented in the continuous integration system.

You can run them locally

```shell
pylint lisainstrument
python -m pytest
```

## Acknowledgment

We are thankful to J. Waldmann for sharing his implementation of long power-law
noise time series generators, based on [Plaszczynski, S. (2005). Generating long
streams of 1/f^alpha noise](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219477507003635). J.
Waldmann's pyplnoise module has been included in this project as a submodule.
