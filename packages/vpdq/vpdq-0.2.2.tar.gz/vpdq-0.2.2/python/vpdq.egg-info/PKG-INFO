# vpdq Python Binding
This is a Python binding library to the vPDQ (video PDQ) hashing algorithm by Meta.

It is written in Cython.

Development is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/main/vpdq).

Windows is currently not supported by the Cython bindings.

## Installation

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vpdq/)

```sh
python -m pip install vpdq --upgrade
```

####  OR

Install locally (run from root vpdq folder):

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python -c "import vpdq"` without error.

### Usage
```py
import vpdq

# A vpdq hash is a list of vpdqFeatures.
#
# Each vpdqFeature has five attributes:
# quality: int
# frame_number: int
# hash: Hash256 (Video frame hashed by PDQ) 
# hex: str (64 digit hex string representation of hash)
# timestamp: double

vpdqFeatures = vpdq.computeHash("my_video.mp4")

for feature in vpdqFeatures:
    print(f"{feature.frame_number},{feature.hex},{feature.quality},{feature.timestamp}")
```

Sample Output:
