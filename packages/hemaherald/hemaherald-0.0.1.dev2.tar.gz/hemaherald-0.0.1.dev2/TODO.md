# TODO

## Testing

- [ ] To test UI properly, need to view all events. This is unavailable in Python 3.11's Tkinter at the moment,
unless https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71592 gets backported (unlikely) or I set up some testing on
Python 3.12.


## Timer

- [ ] Make UI nicer #ui
- [ ] Cover timer views with unit tests
- [ ] Cover timer controllers with unit tests
- [ ] Add several customisable quick config options #feature
- [ ] Implement precise wait time for last tick #feature
