# Voice Recognition using DeepSpeech

This project implements voice recognition using a pretrained model called DeepSpeech v0.9.3 to convert English audio into text.

## Input Format
- The input audio must be in WAV format, preferably with a sample rate of 16 kHz.

## Important Notes
- The clarity of the input audio and the quality of the accent significantly affect the transcription results. Clear and well-articulated speech will yield better results.
