    "# Bootstrap and Jackknife comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we compare the bootstrap to the jackknife. Bootstrap resampling is superior to jackknifing, but the jackknife is deterministic, which may be helpful, and it can exactly remove biases of order 1/N from an estimator. The bootstrap does not have a simple bias estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider as estimators the arithmetic mean and the naive variance $\\hat V = \\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2$ from a sample of inputs. We use `resample` to compute the variances of these two estimators and their bias. This can be done elegantly by defining a single function `fn` which returns both estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact bias is known for both estimators. It is zero for the mean, because it is a linear function of the sample. For $\\hat V$, the bias-corrected estimate is $\\frac N{N-1} \\hat V$, and thus the bias is $\\frac{- 1}{N - 1} \\hat V$.\n"
