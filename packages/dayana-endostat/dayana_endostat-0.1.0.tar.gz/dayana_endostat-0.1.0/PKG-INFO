## Available Functions

### 1. Crown-to-Root Ratio

def crown_to_root_ratio(crown_length, root_length)\
Calculates the ratio of the crown length to the root length.

### 2. Root Canal Volume

def root_canal_volume(radius, length) \
Calculates the volume of the root canal using the formula for a cylinder.

### 3. Pulp Chamber Volume

def pulp_chamber_volume(radius, height) \
Estimates the volume of the pulp chamber, approximated as a cone.

### 4. Anesthesia Dosage

def anesthesia_dosage(weight, dosage_per_kg)\
Calculates the required dosage of local anesthetics based on the patient's weight.

### 5. Success Rate

def success_rate(successes, total_treatments)\
Calculates the treatment success rate as a percentage.

### 6. Failure Rate

def failure_rate(failures, total_treatments)\
Calculates the treatment failure rate as a percentage.

### 7. Surface Area of Tooth

def surface_area_of_tooth(height, radius)\
Calculates the surface area of a tooth, assuming it is conical.

### 8. Average Root Canal Curvature

def average_root_canal_curvature(angles)\
Calculates the average curvature of root canals based on a list of angles in degrees.

### 9. Length Conversion

def convert_length_units(length, from_unit, to_unit)\
Converts lengths between mm, cm, and inches.

### 10. Canal Diameter Calculation

def calculate_canal_diameter(volume, length)\
Calculates the diameter of the canal given its volume and length.
