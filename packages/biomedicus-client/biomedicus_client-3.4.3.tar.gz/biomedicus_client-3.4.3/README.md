# BioMedICUS Client

The BioMedical Information Collection and Understanding System (BioMedICUS) is a system for large-scale text analysis and processing of biomedical and clinical reports. The system is being developed by the Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction Program at the University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics.

This is a collaborative project that aims to serve biomedical and clinical researchers, allowing for customization with different texts.

More information about BioMedICUS can be found on our [website](https://nlpie.github.io/biomedicus).

This package contains the client code for processing documents using deployed BioMedICUS services. The package containing the services themselves is ``biomedicus``.
