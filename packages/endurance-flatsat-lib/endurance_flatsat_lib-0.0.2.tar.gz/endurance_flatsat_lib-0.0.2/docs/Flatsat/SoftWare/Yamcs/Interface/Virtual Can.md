## Can
If you want to use a real CAN interface (instead of a virtual one like `vcan0`), you can follow these steps:

1. **Bring up the CAN interface** (replace `can0` with your actual CAN device name):
   ```bash
   sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
   ```

   In this example, the bitrate is set to 500 kbps. Adjust the bitrate as needed for your setup.

2. **Capture and display CAN messages on the real CAN interface**:
   ```bash
   candump can0
   ```

Make sure your CAN interface (`can0`) is properly connected to a CAN network and the appropriate bitrate is configured to match the network.
