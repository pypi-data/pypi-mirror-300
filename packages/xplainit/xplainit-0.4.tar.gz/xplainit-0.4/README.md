# xplainit

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/xplainit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/xplainit)

`xplainit` is an open-source Python library designed to generate natural language explanations for machine learning model predictions. This tool is especially useful for non-technical stakeholders who need to understand how features impact predictions made by models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or other models built using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Explanations**: Translates complex model outputs into easy-to-understand narratives.
- **Model Support**: Works with Scikit-learn models and is extensible for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other machine learning frameworks.
- **Feature Importance Visualization**: Automatically generates feature importance charts.
- **Easy to Use**: Minimal configuration needed to integrate into any data science pipeline.
