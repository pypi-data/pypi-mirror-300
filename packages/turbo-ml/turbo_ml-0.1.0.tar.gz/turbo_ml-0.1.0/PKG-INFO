- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly terminal interface with tutorials and step-by-step guidance.
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture allows for easy customization and extension.
- **Compatibility**: Supports a wide range of algorithms from scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, and more.

## Installation (Not available yet)

QuickAI is available on PyPI. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install quickai
```

> **Note**: For the latest features and updates, you might want to install from the test PyPI or the GitHub repository.

## Quick Start (Not available yet)

Here's how you can get started with QuickAI in just a few lines of code:

```python
from quick_ai import QuickAI

# Initialize QuickAI with your dataset
model = QuickAI(data='path/to/your/data.csv', target='target_column')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict('not/classified/data.csv')
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

QuickAI automatically preprocesses your data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- Handles missing values with appropriate imputation methods.
- Encodes categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
- Scales numerical features for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

### Model Selection

- Analyzes data characteristics (e.g., number of features, class balance).
- Selects suitable algorithms from a pool that includes scikit-learn classifiers/regressors, CatBoost, XGBoost, etc.
- Supports both classification and regression tasks.

### Hyperparameter Optimization

- Utilizes Optuna for efficient hyperparameter optimization.
- Employs advanced features like pruning to reduce computation time.

### Model Evaluation

- Allows selection of evaluation metrics from scikit-learn or custom weighted sums.
- Supports cross-validation and hold-out validation strategies.
