BGROUND :: semi-automated background subtraction
------------------------------------------------

* BGROUND performs semi-automated background subtraction for XY-data.
	- XY-data = usually a file with two (or more) columns - (X-data,Y-data).
	- The user can define which columns represent the XY-data to process.
* How does it work?
	- BGROUND reads XY-data and shows them in an interactive plot.
	- The user defines background points (with a mouse + keyboard).
	- BGROUND does the rest (background calculation and subtraction).
