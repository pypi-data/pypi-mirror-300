# sopel-emotes

This module searches for emotes in messages from multiple sources (7TV, BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ). It searches for emotes in the format `:emote_name:` and looks them up from the available emote sources based on a configurable priority list. The emote size is also configurable.
    
Features:
- Configurable emote sources and search priority (7TV, BTTV, FFZ) via Sopel config.
- Configurable emote size (small, medium, large) via Sopel config.
- Handles multiple emotes in a single message with rate limiting delays.

Future Tasks:
- Caching
