# pg_index_insight

**pg_index_insight** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help PostgreSQL users analyze and improve the efficiency of their database indexes. This tool highlights inefficient indexes to optimize space utilization, vacuum operations, and overall database performance.

## Why 

`pg_index_insight` is designed to be a simple and effective tool for ensuring your PostgreSQL indexes are efficient. Here are a few reasons why you might prefer using this CLI tool:

- **No extensions required**: Unlike some PostgreSQL performance tools, `pg_index_insight` does not require you to install any database extensions. This keeps your database clean and avoids the complexity of extension management.
  
- **Custom queries without hassle**: With `pg_index_insight`, you can easily run queries to assess index efficiency without needing to modify or set up complex exporters like in Prometheus.

- **Straightforward**: The tool is user-friendly and designed for simplicity. If youâ€™re looking for a tool that allows you to inspect your database's indexes with minimal setup, this CLI will serve your needs well.

- **Portable**: As a standalone CLI tool, you can run it on any environment where you have access to your PostgreSQL database. No additional software or extensive configurations are necessary.
