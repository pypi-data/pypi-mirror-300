    Provides access to common settings to monitor the convergence dynamically during the solution process by checking residuals, statistics, force values, surface integrals, and volume integrals. You can print reports of or display plots of lift, drag and moment coefficients, surface integrations and residuals for the solution variables. For unsteady flows you can also monitor elapsed time.
