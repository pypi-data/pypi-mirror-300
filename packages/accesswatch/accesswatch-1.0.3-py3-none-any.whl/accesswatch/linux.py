    LinuxAccessWatch Class  

    The LinuxAccessWatch class is designed to monitor and retrieve file information  
    related to user access in a Linux environment. It provides methods to obtain  
    metadata such as the last access time, owner UID, owner GID, owner username,  
    and owner group name of a specified file or directory.  

    Methods:
        __init__(file_path: str) -> None:   
            Initializes the LinuxAccessWatch instance with the path to the file or directory.  
            
        get_file_stats() -> None:  
            Gathers file statistics including last access time, owner UID, and owner GID.  
            
        get_owner_uid() -> Optional[int]:  
            Retrieves the user ID (UID) of the file owner.  
            
        get_owner_gid() -> Optional[int]:  
            Retrieves the group ID (GID) of the file owner.  
            
        uid_to_username() -> str:  
            Converts the owner UID to a human-readable username.  
            
        gid_to_groupname() -> str:  
            Converts the owner GID to a human-readable group name.  
            
        get_last_access_time() -> Optional[str]:  
            Returns the last access time of the file in a human-readable format.  
            
        get_username() -> str:  
            Retrieves the username of the file owner.  
        
        get_groupname() -> str:  
            Retrieves the group name of the file owner.  

    Usage:
        To use the LinuxAccessWatch class, instantiate it with a file path, and   
        call its methods to retrieve various access-related information.  

        Example:
            access_watch = LinuxAccessWatch("/path/to/file_or/directory")  
            last_access_time = access_watch.get_last_access_time()  
            owner_uid = access_watch.get_owner_uid()  
            username = access_watch.get_username()  
        
    Exceptions:
        - FileNotFoundError: Raised when the specified file does not exist.  
        - KeyError: Raised when the UID or GID does not exist in the system.  
        - ValueError: Raised when the UID or GID is None.  
        - Exception: A generic exception that can be raised for miscellaneous errors.
