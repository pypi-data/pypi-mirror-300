    """Get the index spells for ACS/PCI patients

    Index spells are defined by the contents of the first episode of
    the spell (i.e. the cause of admission to hospital). Spells are
    considered an index event if either of the following hold:

    * The primary diagnosis of the first episode contains an
      ACS ICD-10 code. This is to ensure that only episodes where the
      main diagnosis of the episode is ACS are considered, and not
      cases where a secondary ACS is present that could refer to a
      historical event.
    * There is a PCI procedure in any primary or secondary position
      in the first episode of the spell. It is assumed that a procedure
      is only coded in secondary positions if it did occur in that
      episode.

    A prerequisite for spell to be an index spell is that it contains
    episodes present in both the episodes and codes tables. The episodes table
    contains start-time/spell information, and the codes table contains
    information about what diagnoses/procedures occurred in each episode.

    The table returned contains one row per index spell (and is indexed by
    spell id). It also contains other information about the index spell,
    which is derived from the first episode of the spell.

    Args:
        episodes: All patient episodes. Must contain `episode_id`, `spell_id`
            and `episode_start`, `age` and `gender`.
        codes: All diagnosis/procedure codes by episode. Must contain
            `episode_id`, `position` (indexed from 1 which is the primary
            code, >1 are secondary codes), and `group` (expected to contain
            the value of the acs_group and pci_group arguments).
        acs_group: The name of the ICD-10 code group used to define ACS.
        pci_group: The name of the OPCS-4 code group used to define PCI. Pass None
            to not use PCI as an inclusion criterion for index events. In this
            case, the pci_index column is omitted, and only ACS primary diagnoses
            are allowed.
        stemi_group: The name of the ICD-10 code group used to identify STEMI MI
        nstemi_group: The name of the ICD-10 code group used to identify NSTEMI MI
        complex_pci_group: The name of the OPCS-4 code group used to define complex
