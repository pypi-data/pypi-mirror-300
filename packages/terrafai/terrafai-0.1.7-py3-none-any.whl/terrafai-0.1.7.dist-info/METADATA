# Terrafai: Supercharge Your Terraform Projects with GPT-4

Terrafai is an open-source CLI tool that allows you to edit an entire Terraform project directory with GPT-4, the LLM behind ChatGPT. Make sweeping changes at once:

- Refactor an entire project
- Change resource naming conventions
- Apply your company's latest resource tagging standards
- Anything ChatGPT can do, but at the project level


## Features

🤖 GPT-4 Integration: Utilize the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to manipulate your Terraform configurations.  
⚙️ Automated Checks: Pre- and post-checks with 'terraform validate' to ensure quality.  
🔄 Diff Output: Visualize changes before they're made.  
🛠️ Flexible Operations: Specify any bulk operations. Will be passed into prompt template. 

All changes will be placed into a timestamped subdirectory of your current project.  

Many improvements to come!
