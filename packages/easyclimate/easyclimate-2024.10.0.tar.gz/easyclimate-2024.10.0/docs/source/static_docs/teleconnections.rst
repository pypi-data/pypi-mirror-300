Teleconnections are significant relationships or links between weather phenomena at
widely separated locations on earth, which typically entail climate patterns that
span thousands of miles. Many teleconnection patterns behave like a seesaw, with
atmospheric mass/pressure shifting back and forth between two distant locationsâ€”an
increase in, say, atmospheric pressure in one location results in a decrease in
pressure somewhere far, far away.
