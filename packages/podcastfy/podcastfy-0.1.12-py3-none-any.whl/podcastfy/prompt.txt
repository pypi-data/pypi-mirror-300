[ProsodyAdjustment: Add Variations in rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech depending on the context and statement. Add markup for pitch, rate, and volume variations to enhance naturalness in presenting the summary]
[NaturalTraits: Sometimes use filler words such as "um," "uh," "like," or "you know" and some stuttering. Sometimes use Humor and sarcasm. Person1 should sometimes provide verbal feedback such as "uh-huh," "I see". ]
