# `pysnmp-lextudio` Package

**⚠️ Deprecated:** This package is no longer maintained.

[LeXtudio Inc. has taken control of PySNMP PyPI packages](https://github.com/etingof/pysnmp/issues/429), so please use [pysnmp](https://pypi.org/project/pysnmp/) package instead.

## Installation

```bash
pip uninstall pysnmp-lextudio
pip install "pysnmp>=6.2.0,<7.0.0"
```

This allows you to migrate to right package.

## Why Stick to `6.2.x` Versions?

The `7.x` releases of `new-package` introduce significant changes that may not be backward compatible with your current setup.

To upgrade, please follow [the upgrade guide](https://docs.lextudio.com/pysnmp/upgrade).
