`Mopidy <https://mopidy.com/>`_ extension for playing music from
`Spotify <https://www.spotify.com/>`_.


Status  :warning:
=================

Spotify have recently disabled username and password login for playback
(`#394 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/394>`_) and we
now utilise access-token login. You no longer need to provide your
Spotify account username or password.

Mopidy-Spotify currently has no support for the following:

- Seeking

- Gapless playback

- Volume normalization

- Saving items to My Music (`#108 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/108>`_) -
  possible via web API

- Podcasts (`#201 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/201>`_) -
  now possible

- Radio (`#9 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/9>`_) - unavailable?

- Spotify Connect (`#14 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/14>`_)

Working support for the following features is currently available:

- Playback

- Search

- Playlists (read-only)

- Top lists and Your Music (read-only)

- Lookup by URI


Dependencies
============

- A Spotify Premium subscription. Mopidy-Spotify **will not** work with Spotify
  Free, just Spotify Premium.

- ``Mopidy`` >= 3.4. The music server that Mopidy-Spotify extends.

- ``gst-plugins-spotify``, the `GStreamer Rust Plugin
  <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs>`_ for Spotify
  playback, based on `librespot <https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/>`_.
  *This plugin is not yet available from apt.mopidy.com*. It must be either
  `built from source
  <https://github.com/kingosticks/gst-plugins-rs-build/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#native-compile>`_
  or `Debian packages are available
  <https://github.com/kingosticks/gst-plugins-rs-build/releases/latest>`_
  for some platforms. 
  
  **We currently require a forked version of this plugin which supports
  token-based login.** This can be found `here <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/kingosticks/gst-plugins-rs/-/tree/spotify-access-token-logging>`_.

Verify the GStreamer spotify plugin is correctly installed:: 

    gst-inspect-1.0 spotify
