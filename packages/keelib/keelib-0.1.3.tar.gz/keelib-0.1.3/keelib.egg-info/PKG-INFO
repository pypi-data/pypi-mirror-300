# About

> "KEE is a joke turned real project. Originally I wanted to have my own cipher system (similar to a caesar cipher) for some of my friends, but then I moved on to ciphering on a binary level, and it became more of an encryption system. After a bit of back-and-forth messaging, I decided to actually make an encryption system and language." - [JaegerwaldDev](https://github.com/JaegerwaldDev)

KEELib is an unoffical KEE library. The original project is [here](https://github.com/JaegerwaldDev/KEE).

## Encrypting/Decrypting files with a key

Encrypting/Decrypting files with a key is simple. First set up an encryptor with your KEE file.

```py
from keelib import Encryptor
encryptor = Encryptor(key_path)
```

Then you can encrypt/decrypt files with the encryptor.

```py
encryptor.encrypt_file(input_file_path, output_file_path)
encryptor.decrypt_file(input_file_path, output_file_path)
```
