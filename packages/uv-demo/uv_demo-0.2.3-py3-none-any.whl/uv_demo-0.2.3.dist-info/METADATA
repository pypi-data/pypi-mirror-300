[![Action | Upload Python Package](https://github.com/lucaspar/uv-demo/actions/workflows/python-publish.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lucaspar/uv-demo/actions/workflows/python-publish.yaml)

A demo for the `uv` package manager. Very useless.

## Setup and Execution

```bash
uv run uv-demo
```

This will install all dependencies (`uv sync`) and run the entrypoint script.

## Integration with GitHub Actions

See the [Upload Python Package workflow file](.github/workflows/python-publish.yaml) for this package.

### Running actions locally

You can use `act` to run GitHub Actions locally. Use cases:

1. While writing a workflow, to test the workflow locally before pushing to the repository.
2. Run the publishing workflow without setting secrets on GitHub.
3. Before opening a pull request, to check the workflow will pass.

It can be installed as a GitHub CLI extension:

```bash
gh extension install https://github.com/nektos/gh-act
cp config/secrets.env.example config/secrets.env
# edit config/secrets.env with the required secrets
gh act --secret-file config/secrets.env
# select medium-sized image in first run.
```

+ [`act` installation](https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html)
+ [`act` usage](https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html)
