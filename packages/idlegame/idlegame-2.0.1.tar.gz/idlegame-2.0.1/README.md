Ever find yourself stuck at your desk during slow moments in software development? **idlegame** is here to save the day! Whether you’re waiting for a build to finish or just need a quick breather, this idle game is your perfect companion to make those downtime moments a little more fun.

## Installation

Getting started with **idlegame** is a breeze. Just whip out your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install idlegame
```

## Usage

Once it’s installed, you can jump right in by typing:

```bash
idlegame
```

## Features

- **Easy to Play**: I literally can't think of a way to make it easier. Install and run in 2 steps!
- **Casual Gameplay**: Ideal for short breaks or when you need to step away from coding.
- **Offline Play**: Even when you’re not actively playing, your nanobots are hard at work.
- **IncrediSave**: Automatic saves mean you’ll never lose progress. It’s like magic.

## How To Play

**idlegame** is a game made for two purposes. One, to entertain you at work. Two, to teach you some zsh commands.
To that end, every command in idlegame is a valid zsh command (or helper command, or real cli).
Play the game by scripting nanobots with nano. These nanobots can collect resources, defend your filetree, and more.

For example,

### Quickstart

```zsh
Logged in as: bb
bb@idlegame % uptime
Here, you'll be able to see what has happened since you last checked on the uptime of your nanobots.
You can create a nanobot with `nano`, but it requires a nanocore. Here's one to get you started.
Recieved: 1 basic nano core
bb@idlegame % nano --name mine&defend -y
Write the logic for your nanobot (type 'done' on a new line to finish):
idle mine
on invasion defend
done
Nanobot 'mine&defend' created!
bb@idlegame % ls
Name           Type      Idle Action    Event Actions                 Current Action                
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mine&defend    Normal    Mine           On invasion: defend           Performing idle action: mine  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bb@idlegame % 
```

The zsh above shows an efficient way to get started. Claim a nano core, and use it to create a Nanobot that mines for gold. However, if someone invades you, the Nanobot will help defend. This is a very useful all-purpose bot.

## I'm stuck

```zsh
man
```
