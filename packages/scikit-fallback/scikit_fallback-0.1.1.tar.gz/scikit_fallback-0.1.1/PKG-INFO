**scikit-fallback** is a scikit-learn-compatible Python package for machine learning
with a reject option.

### 👩‍💻 Usage

To allow your probabilistic pipeline to *fallback*—i.e., abstain from predictions—you can
wrap it with a `skfb` *rejector*. Training a rejector means both fitting your model and
learning to accept or reject predictions. Evaluation of a rejector depends
on *fallback mode* (inference with or without *fallback labels*) and measures the ability
of the rejector to both accept correct predictions and reject ambiguous ones.

For example, `skfb.estimators.ThresholdFallbackClassifierCV` fits the base estimator and then
finds the best confidence threshold via cross-validation. If `fallback_mode == "store"`, then the
rejector returns `skfb.core.array.FBNDArray` of predictions and a sparse fallback-mask property,
which lets us summarize the accuracy of both predictions and rejections.

```python
from skfb.estimators import ThresholdFallbackClassifierCV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV

rejector = ThresholdFallbackClassifierCV(
    LogisticRegressionCV(cv=4, random_state=0),
    thresholds=10,
    ambiguity_threshold=0.05,
    cv=5,
    fallback_label=-1,
    fallback_mode="store",
)
rejector.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Train base estimator and learn best threshold
rejector.score(X_test, y_test)  # Compute acceptance-correctness accuracy score
```

For more information, see the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/sanjaradylov/scikit-fallback/wiki).


### 🏗 Installation
`scikit-fallback` requires:
* Python (>=3.9,<3.13)
* scikit-learn (>=1.0)
* matplotlib (>=3.0) (optional)

If you already have `scikit-learn` installed and it's `scikit-learn<=1.2`, make sure that `numpy<2.0`
to prevent incompatibility issues.

```bash
pip install -U scikit-fallback
```


### 📚 Examples

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for various applications of fallback estimators
and scorers to scikit-learn-compatible pipelines.
