# VS Code Profile Extension Manager (VPEM)

VS Code Profile Extension Manager (VPEM) is a powerful command-line tool designed to help you manage your Visual Studio Code extensions across different profiles. It allows you to dump, categorize, and apply extensions with ease, streamlining your VS Code setup process.

## Status

This project has been developed strictly on Linux, though it should work everywhere.  If you find an issue, please report it in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/drmikecrowe/vscode-profile-extension-manager/issues).

Executables are built using [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) and are available for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  Again, if any issues are found, please report them in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/drmikecrowe/vscode-profile-extension-manager/issues).

## Why?

I tend to use a lot of extensions.  Further, I find myself switching frequently between TypeScript, Python, and now C#.  Sometimes I work in Azure.  Other times in AWS.

I realized that multiple profiles might make more sense than tons of extensions in a single profile.  However, it's also really easy to experiment with extensions and leave unused ones polluting the profile.  This tool helps me keep things organized.

For example, here's how to apply a group of extensions to a profile:

## Process

- First, dump your extensions for all your profiles

- Next, categorizing extensions by searching for common strings and assign to categories

- Finally, apply extensions to a profile

## Installation

To install VPEM, you can use pip:

**Recommended way:**

```sh
pipx install pipx install vscode_profile_extension_manager
```

Alternatively, you may download the released binaries in the repo.  However, these are mass-produced by actions I've pulled from various places, so I can't guarantee they're tested.

Finally, you can also use [jpillora/installer](https://github.com/jpillora/installer) to automate the installation:

```sh
curl -q https://i.jpillora.com/drmikecrowe/vscode-profile-extension-manager! | sh
```

## Usage

Here are some basic usage examples:

- Dump extensions from a profile:

```sh
   vpem dump --profile "Default"
```

- Apply extensions to a profile:

```sh
   vpem apply --profile "Work" --category "Python Development"
```

- List all categories:

```sh
   vpem list-categories
```
