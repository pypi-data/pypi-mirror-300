A package needs:

- pyproject.toml (used to define the metadata and configuration for your package. It provides information such as the package name, version, dependencies, and other details required for installation and distribution.)
- README.md: This file contains the documentation and information about your package. It is commonly written in Markdown format and serves as the main entry point for users and developers to understand how to use your package.

- LICENSE: This file includes the license under which your package is distributed. It is important to choose and include the appropriate license file, as we discussed in the previous response.

- requirements.txt or pyproject.toml: These files are used to specify the dependencies required by your package. requirements.txt is a common format that lists the package names and versions, while pyproject.toml is used in the context of projects using the Poetry dependency manager.

# How to update this package

Note that Git and PyPI are in some ways conflicting systems as they both have their own versioning. Installing the expert_intelligence_toolbox from pip will not install the version from `main` branch at https://github.com/Point-Topic/expert_intelligence_toolbox. Instead, it will install the version most recently uploaded to PyPi https://pypi.org/project/expert-intelligence-toolbox/ (with the highest version number). 

After making a branch on Github and updating the package on PyPI, it is therefore strongly advised to immediately merge that branch to `main`, even if you want to make further changes or there is an issue with the code. This is to ensure that the newest package version on PyPI remains the version stored on `main` branch on the Git repository. 

How to update the package:

1 - create new branch\
2 - make changes to code\
3 - increase version number in pyproject.toml\
4 - update package on PyPI (see below)\
5 - merge branch to `main`

To update the package on PyPI:

Windows:\
`py -m pip install --upgrade build`\
`py -m build`\
Mac/Unix:\
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`\
`python3 -m build`

Finally, for both:\
`twine upload --skip-existing dist/*` (for real package)\


When prompted for credentials:\
Username: \_\_token__ \
PW: enter your token here (WARNING - CTRL-V WILL NOT WORK. IN VSCODE: Edit --> Paste)

NOTE: if you are getting a 403 error, despite using "\_\_token__" as your username, try `twine upload --skip-existing dist/* --verbose` and for some reason this will ask you for your API key (password) as expected.



## Creating a Package (testPyPI, PyPI)
If you have not interacted with this package before, this might be helpful. 

1 - Make a 'wheel' and source distribution file (you pack the source code as binary and tar file)
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`
`py -m pip install --upgrade build`
`py -m build`

2 - go to https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps on that page. Verify your email address. This is not the real PyPI, but a test environment.

3 - To securely upload your project, you’ll need a PyPI API token. Create one at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens, setting the “Scope” to “Entire account”. Don’t close the page until you have copied and saved the token — you won’t see that token again.

4 - Upload to PyPI test index (windows)\
`py -m pip install --upgrade twine`\
`py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`

4 - Upload to PyPI test index (Mac)\
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine`\
`python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`


Username: \_\_token__\
PW: enter your token here (WARNING - CTRL-V WILL NOT WORK. IN VSCODE: Edit --> Paste)
**Note**: 
- Be carefull to check whether you're using the `pypi` or `test.pypi` to access the package.
This tutorial is for `test.pypi`, so if you're using `pypi`, please change from `--repository testpypi` into `--repository pypi`
- If you can't not get to the package using `API key`, using (not recommend, may cause leak private information)
```bash
twine upload -u YOUR-USERNAME -p YOUR-PASSWORD --repository testpypi dist/*
```

5 - you can pull your own package from 
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps expert_intelligence_toolbox (again, this is for the test environment)

6 - make a 'real' package on PyPI. \
delete `dist` directory\
`py -m build`\
`py -m twine upload dist/*`\
Username: \_\_token__\
PW: enter your token here (WARNING - CTRL-V WILL NOT WORK. IN VSCODE: Edit --> Paste)


7 - What if you make any changes? Just repeat.

Change version number in pyproject.toml

Then, For Windows:\
`py -m pip install --upgrade build`\
`py -m build`\
Or, for Mac:\
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`\
`python3 -m build`

Finally, for both:\
`twine upload --skip-existing dist/*` (for real package)\
`twine upload --skip-existing --repository testpypi dist/*` (for testpypi)
