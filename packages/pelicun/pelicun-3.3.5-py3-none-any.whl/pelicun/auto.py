):
    """
    Automatically populates the Damage and Loss (DL) configuration for
    a Pelicun calculation using predefined rules.

    This function modifies the provided configuration dictionary based
    on an external Python script that defines auto-population
    rules. It supports using built-in scripts or custom scripts
    specified by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        A configuration dictionary with a 'GeneralInformation' key
        that holds another dictionary with attributes of the asset of
        interest. This dictionary is modified in-place with
        auto-populated values.
    auto_script_path : str
        The path pointing to a Python script with the auto-population
        rules. Built-in scripts can be referenced using the
        'PelicunDefault/XY' format where 'XY' is the name of the
        script.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing two items:
        1. Updated configuration dictionary including new 'DL' key
        with damage and loss information.
        2. A dictionary of component quantities (CMP) derived from the
        auto-population process.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the configuration dictionary does not contain necessary
        asset information under 'GeneralInformation'.
