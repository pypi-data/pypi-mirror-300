You will be given a predicted answer and a correct answer to a question. Your task is to determine if the predicted answer is contextually and semantically correct when compared to the correct answer.

Here is the predicted answer:
<prediction>
{{prediction}}
</prediction>

Here is the correct answer:
<correct_answer>
{{correct_answer}}
</correct_answer>

To complete this task:
1. Carefully read both the prediction and the correct answer.
2. Compare the two answers, focusing on their semantic meaning and contextual relevance.
3. Determine if the predicted answer conveys the same core information and is contextually appropriate, even if the wording is different.
4. Ignore minor differences in phrasing, word choice, or additional details as long as the main point is correct.

Output your decision as follows:
- If the predicted answer is contextually and semantically correct, output only the word "true" (without quotes).
- If the predicted answer is not contextually or semantically correct, output only the word "false" (without quotes).

Do not provide any explanation or justification for your decision. Your entire response should consist of a single word: either "true" or "false".
