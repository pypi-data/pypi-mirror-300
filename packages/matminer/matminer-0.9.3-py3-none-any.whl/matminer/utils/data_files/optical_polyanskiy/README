This data has been retrieved from https://github.com/polyanskiy/refractiveindex.info-database
on August 27, 2022. The script used to transform the data from the original repository to
an easier-to-use database for matminer can be found in matminer/dev_scripts/dataset_management/handle_refractiveindex.py
This script is ugly because the data format is not homogeneous and many things have been handled by hand.
Do not hesitate to contact Matgenix in case you have troubles to re-create the dataset used by matminer (in case you want to update the database).
