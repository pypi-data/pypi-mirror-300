"""
This module contains implementations for a selection of embeddings:

- activeft.embeddings.empirical_ntk provides implementations for embeddings associated with the empirical NTK kernel.
- activeft.embeddings.classification provides embeddings for classification models.

The respective implementations can be subclassed to implement activeft.model.ModelWithEmbedding.
For more details regarding embeddings, see activeft.model.ModelWithEmbedding.
