Welcome to the pyserpZotero Documentation!
==========================================

pyserpZotero is a Python package designed for automating collection and upload of scholarly literature citations and PDFs.

It currently relies on SerpAPI for stable access to Google Scholar and the free and open source app Zotero for citation management. ArXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and other repositories are leveraged to look for free PDF files. The library can be used directly for custom workflows or as an interactive command line app.
