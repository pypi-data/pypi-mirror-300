Python package for analyzing space-based observations of variable stars
=======================================================================

**seismolab** is an open-source python framework for downloading, analyzing, and visualizing data of variable stars from space-based surveys. The framework is primary intended to be used with data obtained by the Kepler, TESS and Gaia surveys, but can also be used by other similar existing and future surveys. Some modules are useful for analyzing ground-based observations as well.

It has six main modules:

   :columns: 1

   * The *Gaia* module combines Gaia data with the Bailer-Jones distance catalog, galactic extinction maps and magnitudes from the Simbad catalog.
   * The *fourier* module calculates the Fourier coefficients and Fourier parameters of light curves.
   * The *template* module fits a set of Fourier harmonics to a light curve and derives the temporal variation of the amplitude/phase/zero point of the dominant variation.
   * The *OC* module fits a model to the extrema of a light curve to extract the minimum or maximum times and derives an O-C diagram.
   * The *inpainting* module fills gaps in time series data.
   * The *tfa* module provides different transformation methods for time-frequency analysis.
