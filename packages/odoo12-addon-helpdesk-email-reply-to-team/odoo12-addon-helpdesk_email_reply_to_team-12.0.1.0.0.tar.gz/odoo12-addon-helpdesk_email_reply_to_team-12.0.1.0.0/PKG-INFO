Summary: ODOO helpdesk_mgmt email reply to teams. When sending a message from a ticket now the recipient gets as reply-to "catchall@mycompany.com". Instead, the reply to should be "helpdesk-team-alias@mycompany.com". This was fixed for Odoo 14 and this module backports the fix to Odoo 12. (See https://github.com/OCA/helpdesk/pull/381)
