# Blog Writing Pipeline with Agent Reflection

This repository contains a custom Python-based pipeline that automates the process of generating, reflecting, and refining blog content. The pipeline leverages multiple agents (Writer, Critic, SEO Reviewer, Legal Reviewer, Ethics Reviewer, Meta Summarizer) to create high-quality content, optimized for SEO, legally compliant, and ethically sound.

## Features
- **Dynamic Agent-Based Reflection**: Each agent (Writer, Critic, Reviewers) plays a role in generating and improving the blog topics.
- **YAML-Based Configuration**: Flexible task and agent definitions using a simple YAML file.
- **Custom Python Implementation**: Tailored for blog content creation with detailed agent orchestration.
- **Extensible Pipeline**: Easily add or modify agents and tasks as needed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/myaichat/auto_reflection.git blog-writing-pipeline
    cd blog-writing-pipeline
    #to repeat output
    git checkout 00e93b88fbce3788720e8c13a39802209645bffb
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install PyYAML openai rich pypypubsub 
    ```

3. Ensure you have the following directory structure:

    ```plaintext
   auto-reflection/
    ├── config/
    │   └── topics.yaml
    ├── include/
    │   └── agents/
    ├── pipeline/
    │   └── blog_writer.py
    └── main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Define the blog title and execute the pipeline:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        py_pipeline_name='blog_writer'

        yaml_pprompt_config=join('config','topics.yaml')

        title = "Building a Thriving Community: Collaborations and Initiatives at DeepLearning.AI"
        execute_pipeline(title, py_pipeline_name, yaml_pprompt_config)

    ```

2. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The pipeline will generate blog titles and pass them through various agents for refinement. The final output will be printed to the console.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline uses the following agents:
- **Writer**: Generates the initial blog titles.
- **Critic**: Reviews the titles and suggests improvements.
- **SEO Reviewer**: Optimizes the content for search engines.
- **Legal Reviewer**: Ensures the content complies with copyright and privacy laws.
- **Ethics Reviewer**: Checks for ethical concerns.
- **Meta Summarizer**: Aggregates feedback and provides the final refined output.

## Mocking intermediary agents’ response
If you want to mock/reuse any of the previous agent responses:

1. Copy one of the pipeline logs from log\blog_writer to mock\blog_writer. Mock data will be read from [‘ppl_log’][‘agent_response’]
2. Use copy of you ‘*.py’ pipeline name with mock turned on for chats you want to mock:
```
chats = [
    {
        "agent": writer,
        
        "action": "generate_reply",
        "kwargs": {"task_name": "initial_task"},
        "mock": True,
    },
```
3. Use mocked pipeline. YAML prompt config file is the same,
```
py_pipeline_name='mock_blog_writer'

yaml_pprompt_config=join('config','topics.yaml')

title = "Building a Thriving Community: Collaborations and Initiatives at DeepLearning.AI"
#mock config
mock_file=join('mock','blog_writer','blog_writer_topics.json')
assert isfile(mock_file), f"Mock file not found: {mock_file}"
apc.load_mock(mock_file) 

execute_pipeline(title, py_pipeline_name, yaml_pprompt_config) 
```
Now steps you marked as mock=True will draw agent response from mock file:

│    - This title is clear, but it could be more dynamic. You might want to highlight specific benefits or outcomes,   │
│ such as “Collaborative Projects Transforming AI Theory into Real-World Solutions.”                                   │

│ Consider “Fostering Inclusivity: The Critical Role of Diverse Voices in the AI Community.”                           │
│                                                                                                                      │

│ next. For instance, “Conclusion: The Next Frontier in AI Collaboration – What Lies Ahead.”                           │
│                                                                                                                      │
