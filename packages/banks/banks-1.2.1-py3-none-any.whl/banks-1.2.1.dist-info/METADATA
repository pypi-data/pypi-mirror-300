[Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)) is the linguist professor who will help you generate meaningful
LLM prompts using a template language that makes sense. If you're still using `f-strings` for the job, keep reading.

Docs are available [here](https://masci.github.io/banks/).

## Installation

```console
pip install banks
```

## Features

Prompts are instrumental for the success of any LLM application, and Banks focuses around specific areas of their
lifecycle:
- :orange_book: **Templating**: Banks provides tools and functions to build prompts text and chat messages from generic blueprints.
- :tickets: **Versioning and metadata**: Banks supports attaching metadata to prompts to ease their management, and versioning is
first-class citizen.
- :file_cabinet: **Management**: Banks provides ways to store prompts on disk along with their metadata.

## Cookbooks

- :blue_book: [Prompt caching with Anthropic](./cookbooks/Prompt_Caching_with_Anthropic.ipynb)
- :blue_book: [Prompt versioning](./cookbooks/Prompt_Versioning.ipynb)

## Examples

### :point_right: Create a blog writing prompt

Given a generic template to instruct an LLM to generate a blog article, we
use Banks to generate the actual prompt on our topic of choice, "retrogame computing":

```py
from banks import Prompt


p = Prompt("Write a 500-word blog post on {{ topic }}.\n\nBlog post:")
topic = "retrogame computing"
print(p.text({"topic": topic}))
```

This will print the following text, that can be pasted directly into Chat-GPT:

```txt
Write a 500-word blog post on retrogame computing.

Blog post:
```

The same prompt can be written in form of chat messages:
```py
prompt_text = """{% chat role="system" %}
I want you to act as a title generator for written pieces.
{% endchat %}

{% chat role="user" %}
Write a 500-word blog post on {{ topic }}.

Blog post:
{% endchat %}"""

p = Prompt(prompt_text)
print(p.chat_messages({"topic":"prompt engineering"}))
```

This will output the following:
```txt
[
  ChatMessage(role='system', content='I want you to act as a title generator for written pieces.\n'),
  ChatMessage(role='user', content='Write a 500-word blog post on .\n\nBlog post:\n')
]
```

### :point_right: Create a summarizer prompt

Instead of hardcoding the content to summarize in the prompt itself, we can inject it
starting from a generic one:


```py
from banks import Prompt


prompt_template = """
Summarize the following documents:
{% for document in documents %}
{{ document }}
{% endfor %}
Summary:
"""

# In a real-world scenario, these would be loaded as external resources from files or network
documents = [
    "A first paragraph talking about AI",
    "A second paragraph talking about climate change",
    "A third paragraph talking about retrogaming"
]

p = Prompt(prompt_template)
print(p.text({"documents": documents}))
```

The resulting prompt:

```txt
Summarize the following documents:

A first paragraph talking about AI

A second paragraph talking about climate change

A third paragraph talking about retrogaming

Summary:
```

### :point_right: Lemmatize text while processing a template

Banks comes with predefined filters you can use to process data before generating the
prompt. Say you want to use a lemmatizer on a document before summarizing it, first
you need to install `simplemma`:

```sh
pip install simplemma
```

then you can use the `lemmatize` filter in your templates like this:

```py
from banks import Prompt


prompt_template = """
Summarize the following document:
{{ document | lemmatize }}
Summary:
"""

p = Prompt(prompt_template)
print(p.text({"document": "The cats are running"}))
```

the output would be:

```txt
Summarize the following document:
the cat be run
Summary:
```

### :point_right: Use a LLM to generate a text while rendering a prompt

Sometimes it might be useful to ask another LLM to generate examples for you in a
few-shot prompt. Provided you have a valid OpenAI API key stored in an env var
called `OPENAI_API_KEY` you can ask Banks to do something like this (note we can
annotate the prompt using comments - anything within `{# ... #}` will be removed
from the final prompt):

```py
from banks import Prompt


prompt_template = """
Generate a tweet about the topic {{ topic }} with a positive sentiment.

{#
    This is for illustration purposes only, there are better and cheaper ways
    to generate examples for a few-shots prompt.
#}
Examples:
{% for number in range(3) %}
- {% generate "write a tweet with positive sentiment" "gpt-3.5-turbo" %}
{% endfor %}
"""

p = Prompt(prompt_template)
print(p.text({"topic": "climate change"}))
```

The output would be something similar to the following:
```txt
Generate a tweet about the topic climate change with a positive sentiment.


Examples:

- "Feeling grateful for the amazing capabilities of #GPT3.5Turbo! It's making my work so much easier and efficient. Thank you, technology!" #positivity #innovation

- "Feeling grateful for all the opportunities that come my way! With #GPT3.5Turbo, I am able to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently. #positivity #productivity"

- "Feeling grateful for all the wonderful opportunities and experiences that life has to offer! #positivity #gratitude #blessed #gpt3.5turbo"
```

If you paste Banks' output into ChatGPT you would get something like this:
```txt
Climate change is a pressing global issue, but together we can create positive change! Let's embrace renewable energy, protect our planet, and build a sustainable future for generations to come. 🌍💚 #ClimateAction #PositiveFuture
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `generate` extension uses [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) under the hood, and provided you have the
> proper environment variables set, you can use any model from the supported [model providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

> [!NOTE]
> Banks uses a cache to avoid generating text again for the same template with the same context. By default
> the cache is in-memory but it can be customized.

### :point_right: Go meta: create a prompt and `generate` its response

We can leverage Jinja's macro system to generate a prompt, send the result to OpenAI and get a response.
Let's bring back the blog writing example:

```py
from banks import Prompt

prompt_template = """
{% from "banks_macros.jinja" import run_prompt with context %}

{%- call run_prompt() -%}
Write a 500-word blog post on {{ topic }}

Blog post:
{%- endcall -%}
"""

p = Prompt(prompt_template)
print(p.text({"topic": "climate change"}))
```

The snippet above won't print the prompt, instead will generate the prompt text

```
Write a 500-word blog post on climate change

Blog post:
```

and will send it to OpenAI using the `generate` extension, eventually returning its response:

```
Climate change is a phenomenon that has been gaining attention in recent years...
...
```

### :point_right: Go meta(meta): process a LLM response

When generating a response from a prompt template, we can take a step further and
post-process the LLM response by assinging it to a variable and applying filters
to it:

```py
from banks import Prompt

prompt_template = """
{% from "banks_macros.jinja" import run_prompt with context %}

{%- set prompt_result %}
{%- call run_prompt() -%}
Write a 500-word blog post on {{ topic }}

Blog post:
{%- endcall -%}
{%- endset %}

{# nothing is returned at this point: the variable 'prompt_result' contains the result #}

{# let's use the prompt_result variable now #}
{{ prompt_result | upper }}
"""

p = Prompt(prompt_template)
print(p.text({"topic": "climate change"}))
```

The final answer from the LLM will be printed, this time all in uppercase.

## Reuse templates from registries

We can get the same result as the previous example loading the prompt template from a registry
instead of hardcoding it into the Python code. For convenience, Banks comes with a few registry types
you can use to store your templates. For example, the `DirectoryTemplateRegistry` can load templates
from a directory in the file system. Suppose you have a folder called `templates` in the current path,
and the folder contains a file called `blog.jinja`. You can load the prompt template like this:

```py
from banks import Prompt
from banks.registries import DirectoryTemplateRegistry

registry = DirectoryTemplateRegistry(populated_dir)
prompt = registry.get(name="blog")

print(prompt.text({"topic": "retrogame computing"}))
```

## Async support

To run banks within an `asyncio` loop you have to do two things:
1. set the environment variable `BANKS_ASYNC_ENABLED=true`.
2. use the `AsyncPrompt` class that has an awaitable `run` method.

Example:
```python
from banks import AsyncPrompt

async def main():
    p = AsyncPrompt("Write a blog article about the topic {{ topic }}")
    result = await p.text({"topic": "AI frameworks"})
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
