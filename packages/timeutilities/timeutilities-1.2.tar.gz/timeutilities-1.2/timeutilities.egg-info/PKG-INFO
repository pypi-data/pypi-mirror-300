from time import sleep
previous_time = Time.now()
sleep(5)
current_time = Time.now()
#Addition
total_time = current_time + previous_time
print(total_time)
#Subtraction
difference = current_time - previous_time
print(total_time)
#Comparison
print(current_time > previous_time)
print(current_time < previous_time)
print(current_time >= previous_time)
print(current_time <= previous_time)
```
