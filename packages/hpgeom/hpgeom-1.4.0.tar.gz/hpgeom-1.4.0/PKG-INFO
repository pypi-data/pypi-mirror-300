# HPGeom
A lightweight implementation of HEALPix geometry functions, wrapped in a numpy interface.

The implementation is based on the geometric functions in the original [HEALPix](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/) C++ library code.
This package has an all-new API, and also includes compatibility functions with the same interface as [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an easy transition from healpy to `HPGeom`.

## Requirements:

At runtime, `HPGeom` requires [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).

At build time, a working C compiler is also required.

The full suite of tests require [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Install:

The easiest way to install `HPGeom` is from pypi (`pip install hpgeom`) or from conda-forge (`conda install hpgeom -c conda-forge`).

To install the package from source go to the parent directory of the package and run `pip install .`.
To include all test requirements, install optional dependencies with `pip install .[test,test_with_healpy]`.

## Documentation:

Documentation is available at https://hpgeom.readthedocs.io/en/latest .
