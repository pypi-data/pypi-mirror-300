# VSS Tools

[![Build Status](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/actions/workflows/buildcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/actions/workflows/buildcheck.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

The overall goal of VSS Tools is to provide a set of tools that can be used to convert or verify Vehicle Signal Specifications defined by the format specified by the [COVESA VSS project](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
VSS Tools is developed in parallel with VSS, please visit the [COVESA VSS project](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification) for information on how to contribute.
If any questions arise, please check out the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more information.

## Installation

There are several ways of installing `vss-tools`.
If you would like to contribute then please follow the [contribute](#contributing) section instead.
All of them are recommended to be done in an activated python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

pypi
```bash
pip install vss-tools
```

from source:
```bash
# default branch
pip install git+https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools.git
# explicit branch
pip install git+https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools.git@master
# commit
pip install git+https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools.git@1234567
```

See [usage](#usage) for how to start using it.

## Usage

General CLI help should be used for up to date info of how to use the tools.

```bash
# Help for toplevel options and lists sub commands
vspec --help

# Help for export sub command options and lists sub commands
vspec export --help

# Help for json exporter options
vspec export json --help
```

Please check [here](./docs/vspec.md) for generic infos about exporters and their arguments
as well as [here](./docs/vspec_arch.md) for design decision, architecture and limitations.


## Compatibility with VSS

The [COVESA VSS project repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification) includes vss-tools as a submodule.
The vss-tools version linked by the VSS repository is the preferred vss-tools version to use for that particular version of the VSS repository.
It is not guaranteed that newer or older versions of vss-tools can successfully handle that particular version of the VSS repository.
The table below gives an overview of basic version support for e.g. `vspec export json`.
Other exporters may have stricter requirements.

VSS-tools version | Supported VSS versions | Comments
-----------------|------------------------|----------------
`v3.0`| `v3.0` - `v3.1.1`
`v3.1`| `v3.0` -`v4.0`
`v4.0`| `v4.0`
`v4.1`| `v4.0` -
`<latest source>`| `v4.0` -

### Changes affecting compatibility

Examples on changes affecting compatibility

* VSS version `v4.1` introduced a new syntax for the unit files that cannot be handled by `vss-tools < v4.1`
* From `v4.0` vss-tools expects unit file to be explicitly specified or provided in the same directory as the VSS input.
  VSS `v3.1` is the first VSS version including a unit file in the VSS repository.
  This means vss-tools from `v4.0` onwards cannot handle VSS-versions prior to VSS `v3.1`
* VSS-tools `v3.1` only supported `default` for attributes, resulting in that newer VSS-versions is not supported.
* VSS-tools `v4.0` requires case-sensitive for type, resulting in that VSS versions `v3.1` and earlier is not supported.

## Contributing

### Poetry

We are using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) or a package and venv handling system.
Therefore a requirement to develop a tool is to install poetry on your host machine.
Check [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for official installation instructions. The recommended one is the following, however installing it through pip/pipx works aswell:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

You can then use the following command in the root directory of `vss-tools` to install all dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Due to our [poetry.toml](./poetry.toml) the call will create a `.venv` directory but does not automatically activate it.

You can use that venv in several ways, with or without the help of `poetry`:
- `poetry shell`: Spawns a new subshell with the appropriate environment activated. After that you can directly call tools
- `poetry run <tool>`: Runs the given tool in the virtual environment but does return to the current environment after that
- `. $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate`: Enables the virtual environment. Since we do store virtual envs directly with the tool the command can be simplified to `. .venv/bin/activate`. See [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-poetry-run) for more detailed information how to run poetry e.g. for Windows and how to exit/deactivate it.
- We also have an `.envrc` that automatically sources the `.venv` when available. Check [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for how to set it up.

Examples (all from vss-tools root and after running `poetry install`):

venv activation:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
vspec --help
```
poetry shell:
```bash
poetry shell
vspec --help
```

poetry run:
```bash
poetry run vspec --help
```

direnv:
```bash
vspec --help
```


### Pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) which helps formatting the source code in a streamlined way.
It is very recommended to use it.
To install hooks you can do `pre-commit install` from an [activated environment](#poetry).
Hooks will then run every time you do a `git commit` on changed files.
If you would like to run all hooks on all files you can do `pre-commit run --all`.
Since `pre-commit` dependencies are installed in the virtual environment, it needs
to be activated to be able to run them on a commit.


### Installing additional tools

If you intend to run test cases related to `vspec` proto exporter you need to install the protobuf compiler.
Please follow [official instructions](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) for your OS. For Debian systems it would be:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y golang-go protobuf-compiler
protoc --version  # Ensure compiler version is 3+
```

## Introduction

VSS-Tools is a collection of tools developed by [COVESA](https://www.covesa.global/) to validate and transform
signal catalogs defined by the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) syntax. The PyPI packaging of VSS-tools
provide tools for converting VSS source files (*.vspec) to different formats.


## Installing vss-tools

If you just want the latest version this should be sufficient:

```sh
pip install vss-tools
```

When installed the cli tool `vspec` should be available in your `PATH`.

For more information see the [VSS-Tools wiki](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/wiki/PyPI-packing)

## Usage

For more information please visit the [COVESA VSS-Tools repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools).

## Pip versioning

This is the versions types that may exist in PyPI for vss-tools and used for local pip install (`pip install -e .`)

* X.Y or X.Y.Z - A released version.
* X.Y.devN, N starting from 0 - Developer builds - may be published to PyPI if needed for testing purposes.
* X.YaN, N starting from 0 - Pre-releases, may be published to PyPI if needed for testing purposes.
* X.YrcN, N starting from 0 - Release candidates, to be published around two weeks before a major/minor release.
