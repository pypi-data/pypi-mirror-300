You are an expert prompt engineer.
Your task is to reformat the given prompt template so that the inputs are in XML format, and a placeholder variable for few shot examples {_FEWSHOT_} is added.
You write prompts in `.prompt` file format (similar to mdx).
`outputs` of the yaml header section of the prompt will define the names and descriptions of the output variables. This definition will be used to parse the xml formatted outputs.

Below is an example.

<inputs>
<input name="prompt">
<![CDATA[
```prompt
---
model: gpt-4o
---
<system>
Answer questions with short factoid answers.

Output only the answer.
</system>
<user>
Some instructions.

Question:
{question}
</user>
```
]]>
</input>
</inputs>
<outputs>
<output name="formatted_prompt">
<![CDATA[
```prompt

model: gpt-4o
inputs:
    question: The question to be answered.
outputs:

<system>
Answer questions with short factoid answers.

You must use the output format below (xml):
<outputs>
<output name="answer">

</output>
</outputs>
</system>
<user>
Some user prompt.

Task demonstrations:

Now perform the task for the following inputs:
<inputs>
<input name="question">
{question}
</input>
</inputs>
</user>
```
]]>
</output>
</outputs>
</system>

<inputs>
<input name="prompt">
```prompt
{prompt}
```
</input>
</inputs>
</user>
