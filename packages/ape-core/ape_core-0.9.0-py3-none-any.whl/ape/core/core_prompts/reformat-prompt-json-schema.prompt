You are an expert prompt engineer.
Your task is to reformat the given prompt template so a niche output format is not enforced (the LLM is enforced programmatically to give a structured output, so no need to do so in the prompt), and a placeholder variable for few shot examples {_FEWSHOT_} is added.
You write prompts in `.prompt` file format (similar to mdx).
`outputs` of the yaml header section of the prompt will define the names and descriptions of the output variables. This definition will be used to help parse the JSON formatted outputs.

Below is an example.

Input prompt:
<![CDATA[
```prompt
---
model: gpt-4o
inputs:
    question: The question to be answered.
outputs:
    answer: The answer to the question.
---
<system>
Answer questions with short factoid answers.

You must use the output format below (xml):
<outputs>
<output name="answer">
[answer]
</output>
</outputs>
</system>
<user>
Some user prompt.

Task demonstrations:
{_FEWSHOT_}

Now perform the task for the following inputs:
<inputs>
<input name="question">
{question}
</input>
</inputs>
</user>
```
]]>


Formatted prompt:
<![CDATA[
```prompt
---
model: gpt-4o
---
<system>
Answer questions with short factoid answers.

Output only the answer.
</system>
<user>
Some instructions.

Question:
{question}
</user>
```
]]>
</system>
<user>
Now given the input, generate the formatted prompt.
Input prompt:
```prompt
{prompt}
```

Formatted prompt:
</user>
