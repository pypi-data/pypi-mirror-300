The Python based infrastructure provides a _novel_ schema-based, metadata ingress ecosystem, that is meant to streamline the process of biomedical dataset annotation, metadata validation and submission to a data repository for various data contributors.\n\n# Installation\n## Installation Requirements\n* Python version 3.9.0≤x<3.11.0\n* You need to be a registered and certified user on [`synapse.org`](https://www.synapse.org/)\n\nNote: Our credential policy for Google credentials in order to create Google sheet files from Schematic, see tutorial [\'HERE\'](https://scribehow.com/shared/Get_Credentials_for_Google_Drive_and_Google_Sheets_APIs_to_use_with_schematicpy__yqfcJz_rQVeyTcg0KQCINA). If you plan to use `config.yml`, please ensure that the path of `schematic_service_account_creds.json` is indicated there (see `google_sheets > service_account_creds` section)\n\n## Installation guide for Schematic CLI users\n1. **Verifying Python Version Compatibility**\n\nTo ensure compatibility with Schematic, please follow these steps:\n\nCheck your own Python version:\n```\npython3 --version\n```\n\nCheck the Supported Python Version: Open the pyproject.toml file in the Schematic repository to find the version of Python that is supported. You can view this file directly on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L39).\n\nSwitching Python Versions: If your current Python version is not supported by Schematic, you can switch to the supported version using tools like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#switch-between-python-versions). Follow the instructions in the pyenv documentation to install and switch between Python versions easily.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Virtual Environment**\n\nAfter switching to the version of Python supported by Schematic, please activate a virtual environment within which you can install the package:\n```\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\nNote: Python 3 has built-in support for virtual environments with the venv module, so you no longer need to install virtualenv.\n\n3. **Installing Schematic**\n\nInstall the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install schematicpy\n```\n\nIf you run into error: Failed building wheel for numpy, the error might be able to resolve by upgrading pip. Please try to upgrade pip by:\n\n```\npip3 install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n## Installation guide for developers/contributors \n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nPlease note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n### Development environment setup\n1. Clone the `schematic` package repository.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic.git\n```\n2. Install `poetry` (version 1.3.0 or later) using either the [official installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) or [pipx](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx). If you have an older installation of Poetry, we recommend uninstalling it first. \n\n3. Start the virtual environment by doing: \n```\npoetry shell\n```\n4. Install the dependencies by doing: \n```\npoetry install --all-extras\n```\nThis command will install the dependencies based on what we specify in poetry.lock. If this step is taking a long time, try to go back to step 2 and check your version of poetry. Alternatively, you could also try deleting the lock file and regenerate it by doing `poetry install` (Please note this method should be used as a last resort because this would force other developers to change their development environment)\n\n\n5. Fill in credential files: \n*Note*: If you won\'t interact with Synapse, please ignore this section.\n\nThere are two main configuration files that need to be edited:\n- config.yml\n- [synapseConfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient/master/synapseclient/.synapseConfig)\n\n<strong>Configure .synapseConfig File</strong>\n\nDownload a copy of the ``.synapseConfig`` file, open the file in the editor of your \nchoice and edit the `username` and `authtoken` attribute under the `authentication` \nsection. **Note:** You must place the file at the root of the project like\n`{project_root}/.synapseConfig` in order for any authenticated tests to work.\n\n*Note*: You could also visit [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#module-configparser>) doc to see the format that `.synapseConfig` must have. For instance:\n>[authentication]<br> username = ABC <br> authtoken = abc\n\n<strong>Configure config.yml File</strong>\n\nThere are some defaults in schematic that can be configured. These fields are in ``config_example.yml``:\n\n```text\n\n# This is an example config for Schematic.\n# All listed values are those that are the default if a config is not used.\n# Save this as config.yml, this will be gitignored.\n# Remove any fields in the config you don\'t want to change\n# Change the values of any fields you do want to change\n\n\n# This describes where assets such as manifests are stored\nasset_store:\n  # This is when assets are stored in a synapse project\n  synapse:\n    # Synapse ID of the file view listing all project data assets.\n    master_fileview_id: "syn23643253"\n    # Path to the synapse config file, either absolute or relative to this file\n    config: ".synapseConfig"\n    # Base name that manifest files will be saved as\n    manifest_basename: "synapse_storage_manifest"\n\n# This describes information about manifests as it relates to generation and validation\nmanifest:\n  # Location where manifests will saved to\n  manifest_folder: "manifests"\n  # Title or title prefix given to generated manifest(s)\n  title: "example"\n  # Data types of manifests to be generated or data type (singular) to validate manifest against\n  data_type:\n    - "Biospecimen"\n    - "Patient"\n\n# Describes the location of your schema\nmodel:\n  # Location of your schema jsonld, it must be a path relative to this file or absolute\n  location: "tests/data/example.model.jsonld"\n\n# This section is for using google sheets with Schematic\ngoogle_sheets:\n  # Path to the synapse config file, either absolute or relative to this file\n  service_acct_creds: "schematic_service_account_creds.json"\n  # When doing google sheet validation (regex match) with the validation rules.\n  #   true is alerting the user and not allowing entry of bad values.\n  #   false is warning but allowing the entry on to the sheet.\n  strict_validation: true\n```\n\nIf you want to change any of these copy ``config_example.yml`` to ``config.yml``, change any fields you want to, and remove any fields you don\'t.\n\nFor example if you wanted to change the folder where manifests are downloaded your config should look like:\n\n```text\n\nmanifest:\n  manifest_folder: "my_manifest_folder_path"\n```\n\n_Note_: `config.yml` is ignored by git.\n\n_Note_: Paths can be specified relative to the `config.yml` file or as absolute paths.\n\n6. Login to Synapse by using the command line\nOn the CLI in your virtual environment, run the following command: \n```\nsynapse login -u <synapse username> -p <synapse password> --rememberMe\n```\n\n7. Obtain Google credential Files\nRunning `schematic init` is no longer supported due to security concerns. To obtain  `schematic_service_account_creds.json`, please follow the instructions [here](https://scribehow.com/shared/Enable_Google_Drive_and_Google_Sheets_APIs_for_project__yqfcJz_rQVeyTcg0KQCINA). \n\n> As v22.12.1 version of schematic, using `token` mode of authentication (in other words, using `token.pickle` and `credentials.json`) is no longer supported due to Google\'s decision to move away from using OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow. Click [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/oob-migration) to learn more. \n\n*Notes*: Use the ``schematic_service_account_creds.json`` file for the service\naccount mode of authentication (*for Google services/APIs*). Service accounts \nare special Google accounts that can be used by applications to access Google APIs \nprogrammatically via OAuth2.0, with the advantage being that they do not require \nhuman authorization. \n\n*Background*: schematic uses Google’s API to generate google sheet templates that users fill in to provide (meta)data.\nMost Google sheet functionality could be authenticated with service account. However, more complex Google sheet functionality\nrequires token-based authentication. As browser support that requires the token-based authentication diminishes, we are hoping to deprecate\ntoken-based authentication and keep only service account authentication in the future. \n\n8. Set up pre-commit hooks\n\nThis repository is configured to utilize pre-commit hooks as part of the development process. To enable these hooks, please run the following command and look for the following success message:\n```\n$ pre-commit install\npre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\n### Development process instruction\n\nFor new features, bugs, enhancements\n\n1. Pull the latest code from [develop branch in the upstream repo](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic)\n2. Checkout a new branch develop-<feature/fix-name> from the develop branch\n3. Do development on branch develop-<feature/fix-name>\n   a. may need to ensure that schematic poetry toml and lock files are compatible with your local environment\n4. Add changed files for tracking and commit changes using [best practices](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-best-practices-git-commit)\n5. Have granular commits: not “too many” file changes, and not hundreds of code lines of changes\n6. Commits with work in progress are encouraged:\n   a. add WIP to the beginning of the commit message for “Work In Progress” commits\n7. Keep commit messages descriptive but less than a page long, see best practices\n8. Push code to develop-<feature/fix-name> in upstream repo\n9. Branch out off develop-<feature/fix-name> if needed to work on multiple features associated with the same code base\n10. After feature work is complete and before creating a PR to the develop branch in upstream\n    a. ensure that code runs locally\n    b. test for logical correctness locally\n    c. wait for git workflow to complete (e.g. tests are run) on github\n11. Create a PR from develop-<feature/fix-name> into the develop branch of the upstream repo\n12. Request a code review on the PR\n13. Once code is approved merge in the develop branch\n14. Delete the develop-<feature/fix-name> branch\n\n*Note*: Make sure you have the latest version of the `develop` branch on your local machine.\n\n### Example For REST API <br>\n\n#### Use file path of `config.yml` to run API endpoints: \n```\ndocker run --rm -p 3001:3001 \\\n  -v $(pwd):/schematic -w /schematic --name schematic \\\n  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG=/schematic/config.yml \\\n  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \\\n  sagebionetworks/schematic \\\n  python /usr/src/app/run_api.py\n``` \n\n#### Use content of `config.yml` and `schematic_service_account_creds.json`as an environment variable to run API endpoints: \n1. save content of `config.yml` as to environment variable `SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT` by doing: `export SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT=$(cat /path/to/config.yml)`\n\n2. Similarly, save the content of `schematic_service_account_creds.json` as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS` by doing: `export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS=$(cat /path/to/schematic_service_account_creds.json)`\n\n3. Pass `SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT` and `schematic_service_account_creds` as environment variables by using `docker run`\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -p 3001:3001 \\\n  -v $(pwd):/schematic -w /schematic --name schematic \\\n  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \\\n  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT=$SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT \\\n  -e SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS \\\n  sagebionetworks/schematic \\\n  python /usr/src/app/run_api.py\n``` \n\n\n### Example For Schematic on mac/linux <br>\nTo run example below, first clone schematic into your home directory  `git clone https://github.com/sage-bionetworks/schematic ~/schematic` <br>\nThen update .synapseConfig with your credentials\n```\ndocker run \\\n  -v ~/schematic:/schematic \\\n  -w /schematic \\\n  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG=/schematic/config.yml \\\n  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \\\n  sagebionetworks/schematic schematic model \\\n  -c /schematic/config.yml validate \\\n  -mp /schematic/tests/data/mock_manifests/Valid_Test_Manifest.csv \\\n  -dt MockComponent \\\n  -js /schematic/tests/data/example.model.jsonld\n``` \n\n### Example For Schematic on Windows <br>\n```\ndocker run -v %cd%:/schematic \\\n  -w /schematic \\\n  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \\\n  sagebionetworks/schematic \\\n  schematic model \\\n  -c config.yml validate -mp tests/data/mock_manifests/inValid_Test_Manifest.csv -dt MockComponent -js /schematic/data/example.model.jsonld\n```\n\n# Other Contribution Guidelines\n## Updating readthedocs documentation\n1. `cd docs`\n2. After making relevant changes, you could run the `make html` command to re-generate the `build` folder.\n3. Please contact the dev team to publish your updates\n\n*Other helpful resources*:\n\n1. [Getting started with Sphinx](https://haha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)\n2. [Installing Sphinx](https://haha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)\n\n## Update toml file and lock file\nIf you install external libraries by using `poetry add <name of library>`, please make sure that you include `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` file in your commit.\n\n## Reporting bugs or feature requests\nYou can **create bug and feature requests** through [Sage Bionetwork\'s FAIR Data service desk](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/group/8). Providing enough details to the developers to verify and troubleshoot your issue is paramount:\n- **Provide a clear and descriptive title as well as a concise summary** of the issue to identify the problem.\n- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.\n- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\n- **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.\n- **Provide screenshots of the expected or actual behaviour** where applicable.\n\n# Command Line Usage\n1. Generate a new manifest as a google sheet\n\n```\nschematic manifest -c /path/to/config.yml get -dt <your data type> -s\n```\n\n2. Grab an existing manifest from synapse \n\n```\nschematic manifest -c /path/to/config.yml get -dt <your data type> -d <your synapse dataset folder id> -s\n```\n\n3. Validate a manifest\n\n```\nschematic model -c /path/to/config.yml validate -dt <your data type> -mp <your csv manifest path>\n```\n\n4. Submit a manifest as a file\n\n```\nschematic model -c /path/to/config.yml submit -mp <your csv manifest path> -d <your synapse dataset folder id> -vc <your data type> -mrt file_only\n```\n\nPlease visit more documentation [here](https://sage-schematic.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cli_reference.html) for more information. \n\n\n\n# Testing \n\nAll code added to the client must have tests. The Python client uses pytest to run tests. The test code is located in the [tests](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/tree/develop-docs-update/tests) subdirectory.\n\nYou can run the test suite in the following way:\n\n```\npytest -vs tests/\n```\n\n## Updating Synapse test resources\n\n1. Duplicate the entity being updated (or folder if applicable).\n2. Edit the duplicates (_e.g._ annotations, contents, name).\n3. Update the test suite in your branch to use these duplicates, including the expected values in the test assertions.\n4. Open a PR as per the usual process (see above).\n5. Once the PR is merged, leave the original copies on Synapse to maintain support for feature branches that were forked from `develop` before your update.\n   - If the old copies are problematic and need to be removed immediately (_e.g._ contain sensitive data), proceed with the deletion and alert the other contributors that they need to merge the latest `develop` branch into their feature branches for their tests to work.\n\n# Code style\n\n* Please consult the [Google Python style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) prior to contributing code to this project.\n* Be consistent and follow existing code conventions and spirit.\n\n\n# Contributors\n\nMain contributors and developers:\n\n- [Milen Nikolov](https://github.com/milen-sage)\n- [Mialy DeFelice](https://github.com/mialy-defelice)\n- [Sujay Patil](https://github.com/sujaypatil96)\n- [Bruno Grande](https://github.com/BrunoGrandePhD)\n- [Robert Allaway](https://github.com/allaway)\n- [Gianna Jordan](https://github.com/giajordan)\n- [Lingling Peng](https://github.com/linglp)\n',
