#### Looker Object Migrator
The object migrator allows you to preserve a point in time representation of your Looker content (Looks and Dashboards), Folder structure, Content access settings, User groups, User roles, User Attributes and preserve these as a Yaml file. This tool then lets you configure a new instance based on that Yaml file.
