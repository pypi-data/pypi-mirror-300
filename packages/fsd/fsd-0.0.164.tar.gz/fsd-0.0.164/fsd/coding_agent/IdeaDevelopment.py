            "- **Critical File Check:** Carefully review and ensure that all critical files are included in the plan such as  such as `index.js` for React project etc. For JavaScript projects, must check for and include `index.js` in both client and server directories if applicable. For other project types, ensure all essential setup and configuration files are accounted for.\n"
            "- **Creatable Files Only:** Never propose creation of files that cannot be generated through coding, such as fonts, audio files, or special file formats. Stick to image files (all types), coding files (all types), and document files (e.g., .txt, .md, .json).\n\n"
