## More About DeepRed and Personalization AI
DeepRed is the monorepo for centralized Verizon AI service development.
Personalization AI(PZAI) is an centralized personalization framework for building end to end large-scale search & recommender systems. The use cases developed on top of personalization AI can seamless integrate to Verizon personalization ecosystem, scale out to the Verizon AI infrastructure, and measurement framework in the production environment.

Personalization AI provides end-to-end support for:
- Big Data ETL: feature extraction pipeline which matches same pipeline running in realtime environment
- Model Training: large scale distributed model training on Ray and Pytorch Lightning
- Serving: High performance model serving on seldon-core and Ray, support Python/Java/Scala API
- App: Full platform search & LLM application developed in Flutter
