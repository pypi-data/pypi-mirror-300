Installing FullPy
=================

FullPy can be installed with 'pip', the Python Package Installer.


Installation from terminal (Bash under Linux or DOS under Windows)
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the following Bash / DOS commands to install FullPy in a terminal:

::

   pip install fullpy

   
If you don't have the permissions for writing in system files,
you can install FullPy in your user directory with this command:

::

   pip install --user fullpy



Installation in Spyder, IDLE, or any other Python console
---------------------------------------------------------

You can use the following Python commands to install FullPy from a Python console
(including those found in Spyder3 or IDLE):

::

   >>> import pip.__main__
   >>> pip.__main__._main(["install", "--user", "fullpy"])

   
Manual installation
-------------------

FullPy can also be installed manually in 3 steps:

- Uncompress the FullPy-0.1.tar.gz source release file (or any other version), for example in C:\\ under Windows

- Rename the directory C:\\FullPy-0.1 as C:\\fullpy

- Add the C:\\ directory in your PYTHONPATH; this can be done in Python as follows:

  ::

     import sys
     sys.path.append("C:\")
     import fullpy
