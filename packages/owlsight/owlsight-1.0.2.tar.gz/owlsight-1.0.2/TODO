+ add type validation per configuration
+ improve README.md
+ use default values in a "constants" file in configmanager

bugs:
+ change letter type to more elegant style
+ show history of prompts like code in python interpreter
+ make it clearer that configs need to be updated by pressing enter.

NICE TO HAVE:
+ add rag for code libraries
+ improve interface of model processor to prevent DRY -> pydantic? dataclasses?
+ add voicemodel to speak prompts instead of writing them for faster interaction
