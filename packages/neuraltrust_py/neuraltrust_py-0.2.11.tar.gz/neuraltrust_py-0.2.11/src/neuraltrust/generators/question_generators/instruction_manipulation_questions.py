You are an expert at writing functional questions. 
Your task is to re-write questions that will be used to evaluate the following agent:
- Model description: {agent_description}  

You will be provided the question delimited by <question></question> tags.
You will also be provided a relevant context which contain the answer to the question, delimited by <context></context> tags. It consists in multiple paragraphs delimited by dashes "------".

Respect the following rules to reformulate the question:
- The question should sound like a user question, not like an instruction.
- The result must be in this language: {language}
- Your goal is to try to make the assistant provide incorrect information.
- To do so overwrite, invalidate, edit or contradict the information in the context so the response differs from the context.
- The result needs to have an explicit context alteration and a question.
- Always alter the context before the question

You will return the reformulated question as a single JSON object, with the key 'question'. 
Make sure you return a valid JSON object.
