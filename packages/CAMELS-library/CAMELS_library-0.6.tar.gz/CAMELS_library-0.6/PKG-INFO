# CAMELS library

**CAMELS** stands for **C**osmology and **A**strophysics with **M**achin**E** **L**earning **S**imulations. It is a set of thousands of cosmological N-body and state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes. The simulations of the CAMELS project are described in detail in the [2010.00619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00619).

This repository contains the codes and scripts used to analyze the data from the CAMELS simulations.
