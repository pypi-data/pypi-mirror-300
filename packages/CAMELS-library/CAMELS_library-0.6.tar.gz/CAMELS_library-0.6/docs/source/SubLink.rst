SubLink catalogs
****************

The folders ``SubLink`` and ``SubLink_gal`` contain the SUBFIND-based SubLink and SubLink_gal merger trees. The data is organized following the general hierarchical structure described in :ref:`suite_folders`.

The format of the catalogs is the traditional one from SubLink, and we refer the user to the `SubLink documentation <https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/specifications/#sec4a>`_ for further details. We note that these trees are not yet available for SIMBA, but for now only for IllustrisTNG and Astrid.

We make available both SubLink and SubLink_gal versions generated by the SubLink algorithm. SubLink is the dark matter-based version, which corresponds exactly to the method used in the public data release of the IllustrisTNG project, while SubLink_gal is the baryonic-based version, which tracks the baryons across snapshots rather than the dark matter. The differences between the two are modest.
