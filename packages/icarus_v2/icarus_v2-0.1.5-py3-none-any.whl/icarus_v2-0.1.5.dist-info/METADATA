<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeanIFitch/icarus_v2/main/src/icarus_v2/resources/app-screenshot.png)

The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29666248/">Icarus</a> NMR Pressure Jump Apparatus is a novel device used to rapidly switch the pressure within an NMR sample cell. This enables study of the unfolded protein under native conditions and, vice versa, study of the native protein under denaturing conditions. This project is the <a href="https://github.com/vstadnytskyi/icarus-nmr">second</a> version of a monitoring software for the pressure sensors and digital controls. It is responsible for displaying device readings, controlling and testing hardware, and detecting faults. 

Once a DATAQ DI-4108 USB device is detected by the monitoring software, it establishes a connection and begins reading data from the USB device at 4000Hz. The analog and digital channels monitored are as follows:
* Analog:\
	CH0: target pressure sensor\
	CH1: depressurization valve lower sensor\
	CH2: depressurization valve upper sensor\
	CH3: pressurization valve lower sensor\
	CH4: pressurization valve upper sensor\
	CH5: high pressure sensor at the origin\
	CH6: high pressure sensor at the sample
* Digital:\
	CH0: high pressure pump control\
	CH1: depressurize valve control\
	CH2: pressurize valve control\
	CH4: log control

The data is stored in a circular buffer with a default length of 2 minutes. The data is read by many event handlers which each detect certain features in the readings. They then signal events containing their respective data which may be read by the GUI. The event handlers are as follows:
1. Depressurize: detects high to low state transitions in digital CH0
2. Pressurize: detects high to low state transitions in digital CH1
3. Period: detects consecutive high to low state transitions in digital CH1
4. Pressure: detects current pressure of analog CH5
5. Pump: detects drops in analog CH0, signifying the pump stroking
6. Log: detects state changes in digital CH4

The digital channels may be controlled by the software by sending commands to the DATAQ DI-4108. This is used for the following:
1. Toggling the high pressure pump
2. Hardware tests under manual device operation
3. Shutdowns, either manual or when a fatal error is detected by the Sentry

All events are transmitted to the GUI and are rendered in dedicated event plots, history plots, and status indicators. They are also transmitted to a Sentry module which analyzes them to detect leaks and abnormal behavior. In the event of a serious leak, the device will automatically shut down. Pressurize, depressurize, and period events are also transmitted to a logger, which generates LZMA compressed log files. These files may be opened by the GUI for later viewing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### System Requirements
These instructions are tailored for Ubuntu 24, which is the only operating system tested and supported for this setup.

#### Installing Python
Ensure you have Python 3.10-3.12 installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, you can install it using the following commands:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12
```
#### Cloning the Repository
Before you can start setting up your environment, you'll need to clone the repository containing the project. Open your terminal and execute the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SeanIFitch/icarus_v2
cd icarus_v2
```

### Installation

#### Setting Up Your Environment
1. Create a Virtual Environment:
Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively and avoid conflicts between package versions. Run the following command in your project directory to create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3.12 -m venv icarus_venv
   ```
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
Once the virtual environment is created, activate it with:
   ```sh
   source icarus_venv/bin/activate
   ```
#### Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, you can now install all required packages from required-packages.txt. Install these packages by running:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To start the application, ensure you have activated the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   source icarus_venv/bin/activate
   ```
And then, launch the application using:
   ```sh
   python3 src/__main__.py
   ```
Note: the first time the application is run with a DATAQ connected, it will attempt to install a udev rule to allow access to the USB device. This requires admin permissions. If the application fails to connect to the device after a few seconds, reboot your computer to ensure the udev rules are fully reloaded.
