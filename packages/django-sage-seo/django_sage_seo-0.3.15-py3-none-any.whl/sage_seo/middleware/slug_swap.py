class OldSlugRedirectMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):
    """
    Middleware to handle old slug redirection.

    This middleware intercepts 404 responses and checks if the requested URL slug has
    been changed. If an old slug is detected, it attempts to find the new slug and
    redirects the user to the updated URL.

    The middleware uses the `SLUG_TYPE_MAPPING` setting to determine the mappings
    between URL parameter names and their respective content types. If a mapping is found,
    it updates the URL parameters and performs a redirect based on the new slug information.

    Example of SLUG_TYPE_MAPPING in settings:
    SLUG_TYPE_MAPPING = {
        'product_slug': 'product',
        'category_slug': 'category',
        'post_slug': 'post',
        'slug': 'other',
    }

    The middleware performs the following steps:
    1. Intercepts 404 responses.
    2. Retrieves the old slug from the request.
    3. Uses the mapping defined in SLUG_TYPE_MAPPING to find the new slug.
    4. Constructs the new URL and redirects the user.
    5. Logs any errors encountered during the process.

    This helps maintain SEO and user experience by ensuring that outdated links
    continue to direct users to the correct content.
