    """
    The SlugSwap model is used to manage and record the changes in slugs for different
    objects. It helps in redirecting old URLs to new ones, thereby maintaining SEO and
    ensuring that links do not break when slugs are updated.

    Example of usage:
        When an object's slug is updated, an entry in SlugSwap can be created to map the old slug
        to the new slug. This allows for automatic redirection from the old URL to the new URL.
