# 🚀 py-gen-ml

## 🌟 Project Introduction

`py-gen-ml` simplifies the configuration and management of machine learning projects. It leverages Protocol Buffers (protobufs) to provide a robust, strongly typed, and extensible way to define and manipulate configuration schemas for machine learning projects.

### 🔑 Key Features

**📌 Single Source of Truth**:

- The Protobuf schema provides a centralized definition for your configurations.

**🔧 Flexible Configuration Management**:

- **Minimal Change Amplification**: Automatically generated code reduces cascading manual changes when modifying configurations.
- **Flexible Patching**: Easily modify base configurations with patches for quick experimentation.
- **Flexible YAML**: Use human-readable YAML with support for advanced references within and across files.

**🧪 Experiment Management**:

- **Hyperparameter Sweeps**: Effortlessly define and manage hyperparameter tuning.
- **CLI Argument Parsing**: Automatically generate command-line interfaces from your configuration schemas.

**✅ Validation and Type Safety**:

- **JSON Schema Generation**: Easily validate your YAML content as you type.
- **Strong Typing**: The generated code comes with strong typing that will help you, your IDE, the type checker and your team to better understand the codebase and to build more robust ML code.

## 🚦 Getting Started

To start using py-gen-ml, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install py-gen-ml
```

## 💡 Motivation

Machine learning projects often involve complex configurations with many interdependent parameters. Changing one config (e.g., the dataset) might require adjusting several other parameters for optimal performance. Traditional approaches to organizing configs can become unwieldy and tightly coupled with code, making changes difficult.

`py-gen-ml` addresses these challenges by:

1. 📊 Providing a single, strongly-typed schema definition for configurations.
2. 🔄 Generating code to manage configuration changes automatically.
3. 📝 Offering flexible YAML configurations with advanced referencing and variable support.
4. 🛠️ Generating JSON schemas for real-time YAML validation.
5. 🔌 Seamlessly integrating into your workflow with multiple experiment running options:
   - Single experiments with specific config values
   - Base config patching
   - Parameter sweeps via JSON schema validated YAML files
   - Quick value overrides via a generated CLI parser
   - Arbitrary combinations of the above options

This approach results in more robust ML code, leveraging strong typing and IDE support while avoiding the burden of change amplification in complex configuration structures.

## 🎯 When to use `py-gen-ml`
