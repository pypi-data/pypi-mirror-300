## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the **Hacking Shield** client:

```python
from hacking_shield import SQLDetectionClient

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = SQLDetectionClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Define a SQL query
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1;"

# Detect harmful SQL
result = client.detect_harmful_sql(sql_query)

if result:
    print("Detection Result:", result)
```

Replace `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key.

## API Reference
