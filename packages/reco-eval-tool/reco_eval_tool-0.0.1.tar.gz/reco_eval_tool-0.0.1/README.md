# Caer - Modern Computer Vision on the Fly

Caer is a *lightweight, high-performance* Vision library for high-performance AI research. We wrote this framework to simplify your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the **flexibility** to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas. The end result is a library quite different in its design, thatâ€™s easy to understand, plays well with others, and is a lot of fun to use.

Our elegant, *type-checked* API and design philosophy makes Caer ideal for students, researchers, hobbyists and even experts in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.



## Overview

Caer is a Python library that consists of the following components:

Usually, Caer is used either as:

- a replacement for OpenCV to use the power of GPUs.
- a Computer Vision research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

# Installation

See the Caer **[Installation][install]** guide for detailed installation instructions (including building from source).

Currently, `caer` supports releases of Python 3.6 onwards; Python 2 is not supported (nor recommended).
To install the current release:

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade caer
```

# Getting Started

## Minimal Example

```python
import caer

# Load a standard 640x427 test image that ships out-of-the-box with caer
sunrise = caer.data.sunrise(rgb=True)

# Resize the image to 400x400 while MAINTAINING aspect ratio
resized = caer.resize(sunrise, target_size=(400,400), preserve_aspect_ratio=True)
```
