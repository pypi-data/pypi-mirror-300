# PARITCULA

Particula is a simple aerosol particle simulator. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. The goal is to have a robust aerosol (gas phase *and* particle phase) simulation system that can be used to answer scientific questions that arise in experiments and research endeavors.

## Goals & conduct

The main goal is to develop an aerosol particle model that is usable, efficient, and productive. In this process, we all will learn developing models in Python and associated packages. Let us all be friendly, respectful, and nice to each other. Any code added to this repository is automatically owned by all. Please speak up if something (even if trivial) bothers you. Talking through things always helps. This is an open-source project, so feel free to contribute, however small or big your contribution may be.

We follow the Google Python style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). We have contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/uncscode/particula/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and a code of conduct [here](https://github.com/uncscode/particula/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well.

## Usage & development

The development of this package will be illustrated through Jupyter notebooks ([here](https://github.com/uncscode/particula/blob/main/docs)) that will be put together in the form of a Jupyter book on our [website](https://uncscode.github.io/particula). To use it, you can install `particula` from PyPI or conda-forge with `pip install particula` or `conda install -c conda-forge particula`, respectively.

For development, you can fork this repository and then install `particula` in an editable (`-e`) mode --- this is achieved by `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in the root of this repository. Invoking `pip install -e ".[dev]"` will install `particula`, its runtime requirements, and the development and test requirements. The editable mode is useful because it allows seeing the manifestation of code edits globally through the `particula` package in your environment (in a way, with the `-e` mode, `particula` self-updates to account for the latest local code edits).
