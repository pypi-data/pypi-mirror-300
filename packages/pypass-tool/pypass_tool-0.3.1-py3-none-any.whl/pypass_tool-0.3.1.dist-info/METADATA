``pypass-tool`` is a Python-based password management utility that allows users to generate random passwords and store them inside a file for easy recall. It will check for password strength and provide options to adjust the length of the password and exclude specific characters. Users can choose to generate passwords using the command line (CLI), a web browser, or a desktop app.

    new_pass = PasswordGenerator()
    
    # Set the desired password length and characters to exclude
    new_pass.set_password_length(16)
    new_pass.exclude_characters("weak12345")

    # Generate the password with the specified settings
    password = new_pass.generate_password()

    # Get the password strength
    strength = new_pass.evaluate_strength(password)
    
    # Print the generated password
    print(f"Generated Password : {password}")

    # print the password strength
    print(f"Password Strength  : {strength}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
