## Story
I found [Python Protector](https://github.com/xFGhoul/PythonProtector) a couple months ago and have been using it! But recently, I have been encountering issues; the github hasn't been updated since June 7th (as of September 6th), so I decided to use their base, fix the issues, and hopefully update it more in the future!

## Features

- Configurable module system (Enable / Disable Modules)
- Configurable detection system (What it does when something is detected)
- Encrypted logging system with remote uploading
- Discord webhook support
- Clean code
- Constantly updated
