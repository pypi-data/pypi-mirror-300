class EmbeddingSETE:
    """
    This class takes the embedding operations on cdr3 sequences from SETE.
    Each cdr3 sequence will be embedded into 1d numpy ndarray.

    Note :
        In SETE, the authors performed PCA downscaling of TCR sequences after k-mer coding as X input. 
        For Epitope, no encoding operation was performed, but it was converted to a label to be predicted.

        If you want to encode a specific column utilizing the SETE form, 
        you need to change the CSV header of that column to 'CDR3', 
        and you need to make sure that one column has an Epitope header.
