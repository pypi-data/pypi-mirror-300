# `class-email`, a tool for spitting out .eml files from a template and a CSV file

Built for UNSW COMP6[48]41 tutors, because we don't get to use SMTP with Outlook, since we can't add OAuth applications.

See `--help` for usage. Defaults are tailored to the COMP6[48]41 marking spreadsheet for 24T3.
