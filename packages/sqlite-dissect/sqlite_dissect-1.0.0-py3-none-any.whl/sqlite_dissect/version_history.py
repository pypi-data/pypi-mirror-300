        Note:  The updated cells currently only apply to table leaf pages (table master schema entries that are not
               "without rowid" tables).  Therefore no index pages will have updated cells.  This is due to the fact
               that updates are determined off of the row id at the moment which is only available in the b-tree table
               pages.  However, it is important to note that even if the row id is the same and that cell is determined
