        This function will write the list of cells sent in to the sheet specified including the metadata regarding
        to the file type, page type, and operation.

        Note:  The types of the data in the values can prove to be an issue here.  We want to write the value out as
               a string similarly as the text and csv outputs do for example even though it may contain invalid
               characters.  When data is sent into the openpyxl library to be written to the xml xlsx, if it is a
               string, it is encoded into the default encoding and then checked for xml illegal characters that may
               pose an issue when written to the xml.  In order to properly check the values and write them accordingly
               through the openpyxl library we address the following use cases for the value in order:
               1.)  If the value is a bytearray (most likely originally a blob object) or a string value, we want to
                    write the value as a string.  However, in order to do this for blob objects or strings that may
                    have a few bad characters in them from carving, we need to do our due diligence and make sure
                    there are no bad unicode characters and no xml illegal characters that may cause issues with
                    writing to the xlsx.  In order to do this we do the following:
                    a.)  We first convert the value to string if the affinity was not text, otherwise we decode
                         the value in the database text encoding.  When we decode using the database text encoding,
                         we specify to "replace" characters it does not recognize in order to compensate for carved
                         rows.
                    b.)  We then test encoding it to UTF-8.
                         i.)   If the value successfully encodes as UTF-8 nothing is done further for this step.
                         ii.)  If the value throws an exception encoding, we have illegal unicode characters in the
                               string that need to be addressed.  In order to escape these, we decode the string
                               as UTF-8 using the "replace" method to replace any illegal unicode characters
                               with '\ufffd' and set this back as the value.
                    c.)  After we have successfully set the value back to a UTF-8 compliant value, we need to check
                         the value for xml illegal characters.  If any of these xml illegal characters are found,
                         they are replaced with a space.  This behaviour may be different from how values are output
                         into text or csv since this is being written to xml and additional rules apply for certain
                         characters.
                         between the xlsx output and text/csv output in reference to xml illegal characters.
                    d.)  After all the illegal characters are removed, due to the way openpyxl determines data types
                         of particular cells, if a cell starts with "=", it is determined to be a formula and set as
                         that in the data type field for that cell.  This causes issues when opening the file in excel.
                         Microsoft Excel recommends prefacing the string with a single quote character, however,
                         this only seems to be within Excel itself.  You can specify the data type of the cell in
                         openpyxl, but not in the write-only mode that is being used here.  In order to work around
                         this, we check if the first character of a string or bytearray is a "=" character and preface
                         that string with a space.  There may be better ways to handle this such as not using the
                         write-only mode.
                         Note:  Additionally to the "=" character, the "-" character has similar issues in excel.
                                However, openpyxl explicitly checks on the "=" character being the first character
                                and setting that cell to a formula and does not handle the use case of a cell starting
                                with the "-" character, so this use case is ignored.
               2.)  If the value does not fall in one of the above use cases, we leave it as is and write it to the
                    xlsx without any modifications.

        Note:  If the value is None, we leave it as None.  We used to update the None value with the string "NULL"
               since issues could be seen when carving cells where the value is None not because it was NULL originally
               in the database, but because it was unable to be parsed out when it may have actually had a value (when
               it was truncated).  Distinction is needed between these two use cases.

        Note:  It was noticed that blob objects are typically detected as isinstance of str here and strings are
               bytearray objects.  This needs to be investigated why exactly blob objects are coming out as str
               objects.

        Note:  Comparisons should be done on how other applications work with different database text encodings in
               reference to their output.

        Note:  The decoding of the value in the database text encoding should only specify replace on a carved entry.
