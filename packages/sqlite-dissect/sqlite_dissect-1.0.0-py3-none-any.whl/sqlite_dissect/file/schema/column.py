        When the column text is sent in, the column text starts from the first column name until the "," in the
        following form:
        "COLUMN_NAME ... ,"

        Any comments that may appear before the COLUMN_NAME or after the "," should already be parsed and sent in
        through the constructor as the comments field.  However, there may still be comments in the column text
        itself, where the "...." appear above.  These are parsed out here and removing them from the column text.
        After the column text has all the comments removed, all multiple whitespace character segments including
        newlines, etc. are replaced by single whitespace characters and then the column text is stripped.  Comments
        are only stripped since the "-- ... \n" comment form cannot have more than the terminating "\n" character
        in it and the "/* ... */ segment may have "\n" characters in it for a reason, such as length of the comment.

        The way the comments are parsed out here is done by character and skipping ahead instead of pattern matches
        since technically a comment may have another comment form in it.

        Any comment pulled out from any place in the column definition is considered on the column definition level,
        and not tied to specific constraints, data types, etc.

        Note:  The self.column_text field will be set to the column text sent into this class with only whitespace
               modifications to strip the text and replace multiple whitespace characters with a single space, " ".

        If there is a remaining column text then we parse through it since there is either at least one data type
        or column constraint defined.

        There are 0..1 data types and 0...* column constraints if there is remaining column text.

        Note:  The following statements are valid column definitions:
               1.) field previous_field TEXT
               2.) field TEXT INTEGER BLOB

               This was noticed in a database that had a create table statement that had multiple field names but did
               not throw an error in SQLite.  This is because SQLite pulls the first field as the column name and then
               takes the string until it hits a column constraint as the whole data type field.  In the above examples,
               the derived data types would be:
               1.) previous_field TEXT
               2.) TEXT INTEGER BLOB

               SQLite checks for the data type seeing if certain patterns are in this string in a certain order (see
               the _get_column_affinity function for more information).  Therefore, the affinities of the two examples
               above would be:
               1.) TEXT
               2.) INTEGER

               Due to this, we parse out the data type the same way as SQLite.  We move through the file until we find
               a column constraint or the end of the column definition and then take that as the data type segment to
               check on.  Keep in mind there are more use cases that are tokenized during this process in SQLite.  For
               instance, if the column definition "field previous_field TEXT as BLOB" was specified, it would fail in
               SQLite since "as" is a word that is identified as a particular use case in addition to column
               constraints.  This will not be worried about here since this will address all use cases allowed by SQLite
               and be a superset of all of the use cases allowed for better compatibility instead of trying to handle
               all of the same token use cases in the SQLite library.
