This script holds the objects used for parsing the write ahead log commit records.

This script holds the following object(s):
WriteAheadLogCommitRecord(Version)

"""


class WriteAheadLogCommitRecord(Version):

    """

    This class extends the Version class and represents a version based on a commit record in the WAL file.  The
    database is not considered "committed" until a frame appears in the WAL file with a size of database in pages field
    set declaring it a commit record.  The SQLite drivers do not read any information out after the last commit record
    (if there is any information).  Therefore we structure each set of frames up to a commit record as a commit record
    version and parse it as such.

    Due to the way only parts of the commit record are updated, only parts of the SQLite database will be parsed and
    stored in this class.  For instance, the database header and master schema will only be parsed if they are changed
    from the previous version.  Otherwise, the last database header and last master schema will be set with the previous
    version's for reference.  If the database header and/or master schema is modified, then the objects will be parsed.
    Also, their respective modified flags will be set.  This is to reduce memory and parsing time.

    The idea here is that the database header or master schema should never be needed unless changes were done which
    can be checked by their respective modified flags which are set in the version and set to true for the original
    database.

    However, in order to support the version class, functions have been put in place that will pull the master schema,
    root page, and database header for this version if needed, on demand (unless the "store in memory flag" is set).

    The freelist pages and pointer map pages are always parsed since the overhead to do so is minimal and freelist pages
    need to be parsed in order to ensure changes in the pages.

    If the "store in memory" flag is set, the commit record will be fully parsed and stored in memory.  This includes
    the database header and master schema, regardless of changes, and all pages including b-tree pages.  This flag is
    defaulted to False rather than True as it is defaulted to in the database class due to the nature of how the commit
    records are parsed vs the original database.

    Note: The version number of the first commit record defined must start at 1.  The previous version to the first
          WAL commit record is 0 and will be the base SQLite database file.

    Note: The following fields will be parsed on demand unless this commit record has specific updated pages with
          regards to them (unless the "store in memory" flag is set):
          1.) self._database_header
          2.) self._root_page

          Note:  The root page may not be set if the database header is set since the root page refers to the master
                 schema and not the database header.  However, the root page will always be set if the master schema
                 is set and vice-versa.

          3.) self._master_schema

        commit record contains any of these pages in the frame array.

                   space at the end indicating additional pages  when calculating page size from file size.  The
                   database class has additional documentation on this occurring and allows this since it has not been

        These fields are changed whenever the database file is unlocked after having been modified.  However,

        the change counter may not be incremented on each transaction.

        a WAL file.  However, these fields were found incremented in commit records of the WAL file outside of
        checkpoints occurring.  It is still not sure exactly what may or may not cause these fields to increment
        in the WAL commit record itself.

        1.) Both fields exist in the database header differences.
