        Make sure the database size in pages is not 0.  If this occurs, the version has to be prior to 3.7.0.  If the
        size is 0 and the version is < 3.7.0 we set the database size in pages to the calculated number of pages
        computed from the file size multiplied by the page size.  If the version is >= 3.7.0, we raise an exception.

        If the database size in pages is not 0, there is still a use case that could cause the page size to be
        incorrect.  This is when the version valid for number does not match the file change counter.  Versions before
        3.7.0 did not know to update the page size, but also did not know to update the version valid for number.  Only
        the change counter was updated.  Therefore, in the use case where a file could be made with a version >= 3.7.0
        where the database size in pages is set as well as the version valid for number but then closed down, opened
        with a SQLite driver version < 3.7.0 and modified, the version valid for number would not match the change
        counter resulting in what could possibly be a bad database size in pages.

        Note:  If the file is opened back up in a version >= 3.7.0 after being opened in a previous version, the
               database size in pages and version valid for number are set correctly again along with the file change
               counter on the first modification to the database.  It is important to note this was only tested using
               WAL mode and the base database file remained with the incorrect information until the WAL updated it
               either at a checkpoint or file closure.  Rollback journals are assumed to also update this but have not
               been observed as of yet.
