        The version history will be iterated through and the respective subclass will use the master schema entry
        parsed from every version where that master schema entry is found.  The version numbers where the master schema
        entry is found until the last version it is found in (if applicable) will be set at the parser starting version
        number and parser ending version number.

        In addition, the version number may be set for a specific version to be parsed.  This way if you only want a
        specific version to be parsed, you can specify the version number.  If you want the range between two specific
        versions, the version number and ending version number can be specified to parse the versions in between
        (including the specified version number and ending version number).  If these fields are set the parser
        starting and ending version number will be set accordingly to be within the range of these versions, if
        existing, otherwise None.  If the master schema entry does not exist in between the versions, a warning will
        be raised and the subclass will handle the use case accordingly (either by creating and empty object(s) or a
        "empty" class depending on implementation).

        The md5_hash_identifier field is used from the master schema entry to identify it across the versions.  Due
        to this, it does not matter what master schema entry from what version you choose.  The md5_hash_identifier
        is derived from the row id, name, table name, type, and sql to ensure uniqueness.  (Root page numbers can be
        updated.)

        Note:  The use case where the same master schema entry is removed and re-added needs to be addressed in the wal
               file and is not fully supported here.
