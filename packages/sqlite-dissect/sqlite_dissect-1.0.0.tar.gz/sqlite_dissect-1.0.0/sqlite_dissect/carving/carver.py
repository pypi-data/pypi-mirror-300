            In order to carve the freeblocks we have to start from the ending match and move backwards through the
            matches in the freeblock.  This is due to the fact that when a freeblock is made, it can be reallocated,
            and then have the entry deleted again in it expanding it back to the original size it previously was.  When
            a freeblock is reallocated it counts the space it needs from the end of the freeblock rather than from
            the beginning.  This means that the ending portion (usually the data) of the previous freeblock that was
            in the spot will be overwritten.  Therefore, there is a good chance we should be able to parse out the last
            match successfully, but will end up have truncated carvings "beneath" the last one.

            As an example freeblocks are overwritten in the following pattern:
                        [Third Freeblock Entry .............]
                    [Second Freeblock Entry ................]
            [First Freeblock Entry .........................]

                    [Second Freeblock Entry ................]
            [First Freeblock Entry .........................]

        In reference for supporting freeblocks and additional use cases in unallocated space:

        Currently, unallocated space is carved using a full signature (not removing the first serial type) in order
        to detect deleted entries.  This can result in the following two use cases in reference to deleted entries
        in the unallocated space:
        1.) Cell entries that were deleted or left over from a previous page being reused that ended up in the
            unallocated space where the serial type header (excepting possibly the header size) of the payload
            is in tact.  Due to the way cells are inserted from the back of the page moving forward it is very
            likely to have the beginning of the cell as well (but not a certainty).
        2.) Freeblocks that had either a payload, row id, or serial type header size that one or more of which were
            either 2 byte or greater varints.  This would push the serial type header (excepting possibly the header
            size) into the main body of the freeblock.  This is due to the fact that the freeblock overwrites the first
            4 bytes of the entry with the next freeblock offset and freeblock size.  A freeblock needs at least 4 bytes
            to exist, and if not, it is a fragment.  Keep in mind this is also assuming a b-tree table leaf page and
            may not be the case for b-tree index pages or b-tree table interiors.

            In comparison to the not detected use case below, it is important to note that the first serial type may
            also be a varint of length greater than 2 bytes and therefore still detected where The #1 use case below
            is true but would incorrectly determine the size of the varint causing issues parsing the body of the cell.
            Additional research and handling of this use case is needed.

        The use of a "full" signature will not detect:
        1.) Freeblocks that have a payload, row id, and serial type header size of 1 varint will end up having the first
            serial type overwritten (excepting the use case defined in #2 above) which will result in the entries
            not being carved unless checking for the signature without the first serial type, like freeblocks are done.

            There are a few ways to do this (very similar to the freeblock carving code above) and needs to
            be implemented.

        Discussion:  There are a few ways to determine freeblocks.  One way is to calculate the size of the serial type
                     definition plus 1 byte for the header (depending on size) and compare that to the previous byte to
                     see if it matches.  If it does, the full header should be in tact and the body content can be
                     calculated from the serial type definition.  (The body content may still be able to be calculated
                     from the serial type definition without finding the serial type header length assuming the rest of
                     the serial types are all existent (the first serial type or portion of first multi-byte varint
                     serial type is not missing).  Once the body content and header content are calculated, moving
                     backwards the bytes can be checked for the size of the freeblock + 4 adding on one byte for each
                     byte gone back that does not match the size (this is to account for larger than 1 byte varints for
                     payload or row id).  If this is within the acceptable range of the varint sizes and matches the
                     size, there is a good chance this is a freeblock.

                     Pseudocode:

                     serial_type_header_size =
                            ord(unallocated_space[serial_type_definition_start_offset - 1:
                                                  serial_type_definition_start_offset])

                     if serial_type_header_size ==
                                            serial_type_definition_end_offset - serial_type_definition_start_offset + 1
                        This is the serial type header size (1 is added for the one byte serial type header byte size).
                     else:
                        This is not the serial type header size or the first serial type may be a multi-byte varint
                        use case which would then cause this process to move back one byte and repeat or the serial
                        type header size may be a multi-byte varint.

                        However the third use case below should be predetermined in the above serial_type_header_size
                        setting statement based on the size between the serial_type_definition_end_offset and
                        serial_type_definition_start_offset.

                     After the above:

                     Given additional_serial_type_header_bytes is the amount of extra bytes for the header calculated
                     above and header_start_offset refers to the location the full header starts at:
                     calculated_payload_length = additional_serial_type_header_bytes +
                                                 serial_type_definition_end_offset -
                                                 serial_type_definition_start_offset + body_content_size + 4
                     if calculated_payload_length ==
                                    unpack(b">H", unallocated_space[header_start_offset - 2:header_start_offset])[0]:
                        There is a freeblock possibility but may also be a payload to a b-tree index cell.
                     else:
                        This may be a table leaf cell where this first number would be the row id, in which we should
                        reverse parse out the varint and then check the next index for the size (excepting adding in the
                        size of the row id since the payload size is only the actual payload following the row id).

                    A similar process could be used for parsing out cells that are not freeblocks in order to determine
                    things such as payload size, row id, serial type header length, or missing (or partially missing
                    portion of a multi-byte varint) first serial type in actual cells.  This will be left up to the
                    CarvedBTreeCell class to do and the above documentation may end up applying more to that class
                    then here.

        Note:  Overflow still needs to be addressed.

        Note:  The above use cases have been determined from investigation into how SQLite stores data and may not be
               a complete list.

        At this point we have carved all the "full signatures" in reference to the full serial type definition in

        the use case where the combination of the payload, row id, and/or payload header varint equate out to 4 or
        more bytes), the use case still remains where all 3 are 1 byte as well as the first serial type.  In this case
        we would only have the 2nd through Nth serial types like the above code in carve freeblocks.  Therefore, we
        recompute the signature removing the first serial type, recheck for patterns and if they do not match the
        patterns above, add them as well.


        Note:  If this matches, it does not mean this is necessarily a freeblock since it could have just have been a
               cell removed and then overwritten partially by another cell.  Use cases like these should be addressed
