## Overview


The `starrail` package is a CLI (command-line interface) tool designed for managing and interacting with the game, Honkai: Star Rail, directly from your terminal. 



### Key Features:
- **Game Launch Control**
   - Start/Stop the game application directory from the terminal (skips launcher).
   - Schedule the game to start/stop at any given time (i.e. 10:30AM).

     
- **Simple Automation**
   - Custom Macros: Record and playback recorded mouse + keyboard click sequences in-game.
   - Uniform Click: Allows automatic uniform-interval mouse clicking (duration can be randomized).

     
- **Binary Decoding**
   - Web Cache: Access decoded web cache URLs containing information about pulls, events, and announcements.
   - Streaming Assets: Access detailed client streaming asset information (read-only).
   - Supplement Binary Decoder: Provides supplementary tools to decode any ASCII-based binary file.

     
- **Other Features**
   - Screenshots: Open the screenshots directory from the CLI without the game launcher. 
   - Official Pages: Open the official HoyoVerse web pages easily from the CLI.

<br/>





> [!NOTE]  
> **Installation Requirements**
>  - Windows 10 or later

# Start CLI

The `starrail` package provides its own standalone CLI environment. You may access the CLI by running:
```shell
> starrail
```
This will bring up the StarRail CLI environment where all the commands can be executed without the `starrail` prefix.

![ABC](https://i.imgur.com/cFKRjFV.png)

The StarRail CLI environment facilitates efficient execution of the package's supported commands (see Usage Guide section below). Although all commands can be executed directly outside of the CLI environment in any terminal, activating the StarRail CLI allows you to run commands without the `starrail` prefix.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Inside of the StarRail CLI:
> ```shell
> > about
> ```
> 
> Outside of the StarRail CLI (any terminal):
> ```shell
> > starrail about
> ```


For this guide, all following commands will be shown as if the CLI environment has not been activated.

## 4. Simple Automation
The `starrail` package supports two automation features to assist with the gameplay of Honkai: Star Rail.

### â˜† Custom Automation
This feature enables users to record a sequence of keyboard and mouse actions and replay them within the game. It is specifically optimized for Honkai: Star Rail, ensuring that all actions are only recorded and executed when the game is in focus, thereby preventing unintentional interactions with other applications.

To start, enter the following to bring up the help panel for automation:
```shell
> starrail automation
```

```
Example Command             Description
--------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------
starrail automation record  Create and record a new automation sequence (macros)
starrail automation show    List all recorded automation sequences
starrail automation run     Run a recorded automation sequence
starrail automation remove  Delete a recorded automation sequence
starrail automation clear   Delete all recorded automation sequences
```
> [!NOTE]
> **For a full documentation / guide on custom automation**, visit [this page](https://github.com/ReZeroE/StarRail/wiki/6.-Simple-Automation). 


<br/>


### â˜† Uniform Clicks
This feature assists with repetitive mouse clicking (such as for "Start Again" after completing a stage in HSR).

To use this feature, run:
```shell
> starrail click
```

<br/>

**For example**, to control the mouse to click:
1. Once every 5 seconds and
2. Hold for 2 seconds each click
```shell
> starrail click --interval 5 --randomize 1 --hold 2
```

<br/>

The `starrail` package supports the following simple commands to access Honkai: Star Rail's official pages.

### â˜† Offical Homepage
To start Honkai: Star Rail's Official Home Page, run:
```shell
> starrail homepage
OR

<br/>

## 6. Binary Utilities

The `starrail` package supports a list of binary-related utility commands for web cache and streaming assets decoding.

### â˜† Web Cache
Honkai: Star Rail's web cache stores recent web data. To access the decoded web cache URLs containing cached information about events, pulls, and announcements without loading into the game, run:
```shell
> starrail webcache
```
The results will be listed in two sections:
1. Events/Pulls Web Cache
2. Announcements Web Cache


<br/>

### â˜† Cached Pulls
To access your Honkai: Star Rail's cached pulls information without logging in to the game, run:
```shell
> starrail pulls
```
Web view of all the pull information will open in the default browser.

<br/>

### â˜† Supplement Binary Decoder
The package provides this supplementary tools to decode any ASCII-based binary file.
```shell
> starrail decode --path <path_to_file>
```
All ASCII-based information will be outputted into a table with index listings as following:
```
  Index  Content
-------  --------------
      0  This is a test
      1  /Root xxxx 0 R
      2  /Info 1 0 R>>
      3  start ref
    ...  .....
```

<br/>

***

<br/>


## 7. Misc Utilities

The `starrail` package provides the following quality-of-life utility features to quickly access key game information.

### â˜† Access Screenshots
To access the screenshots without the client or searching through the directory, run:
```shell
> starrail screenshots
```

<br/>

### â˜† Access Game Logs
To access the game's log files, run:
```shell
> starrail game-logs
```

<br/>


### â˜† Session runtime
To get the runtime of the current Honkai: Star Rail session (how long the game has been running since it started), run:
```shell
> starrail runtime
```

<br/>
