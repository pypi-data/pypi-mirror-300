**Command-Line Interface (CLI) Usage**

VexilPy provides a command-line interface (CLI) to perform various tasks such as running the application, cleaning pycache files, and running processes directly from the CLI.

To use the CLI, you can run the following commands:

*Updated in v11* | - Run the application with GUI:
```commandline
python -m vexilpy --RunGui
```

*Updated in v11* | - Clean pycache files:
```commandline
python -m vexilpy --Clean
```

*Updated in v11* | - Run a process directly from the CLI:
```commandline
python -m vexilpy --Run-Process "<process_command>"
```

**VexilPy Configuration**

VexilPy supports configuration in YAML.

*Updated in v11* | - To link a .yaml file, run your file like this:
```commandline
python main.py -F vexilconfig.yaml
```
or
```commandline
python main.py --File vexilconfig.yaml
```

*Updated in v11* | If you don't provide a vexilconfig file, VexilPy will automatically create (if needed) and use `vexilconfig.yaml`.
A warning will be logged if the file has to be created.

```log
WARNING | No vexilconfig.yaml file found. Creating a new one.
```

**Important Note**

Please note that the `backendutils` directory is not intended to be accessed directly. It contains internal utilities and modules used by VexilPy. Any code within this directory should not be modified or accessed directly.
