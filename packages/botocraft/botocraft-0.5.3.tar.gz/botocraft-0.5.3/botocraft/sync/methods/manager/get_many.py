    Generate the code for the ``get_many`` method.  This differs from the
    ``list`` method in that sometimes the boto3 operation that handles listing
    does not actually return all the data we need to create our model.  In those
    cases, there is usually a separate boto3 operation that returns lists of
    objects that we can use to get the full data we need.

    When this happens, the ``get_many`` boto3 operation typically cannot be
    paginated, otherwise we would have used it as the ``list`` method.
