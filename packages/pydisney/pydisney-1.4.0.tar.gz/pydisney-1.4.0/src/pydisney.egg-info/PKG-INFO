# Disney+ API wrapper

A future rich API wrapper for Disney+ made with python.


## How to install
    pip install pydisney

https://pypi.org/project/pydisney

## Usage/Examples

### Simple search
```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI

api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password")
searches = api.search("Star wars")
print(searches[0].title) # prints title of the first search hit
```
### Advanced usage

```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI
from pydisney import HitType
from pydisney import Language
from pydisney import Rating

# forces to use disney's login api instead of cached access and refresh tokens
# sets proxies
api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password", proxies={}, force_login=True)

profileId = api.get_profiles()[0].id  # grabs the first profile's id
print(api.set_active_profile(profileId)) # if profile is locked, pass pin as an argument
print(api.get_active_profile())

api.set_language(Language.POLISH)  # sets language to Polish, from now all data will be returned in that language

searches = api.search("Star wars", rating=Rating.AGE9PLUS)
print(searches[0].title)

# checks if the search hit is a series or a movie
if searches[0].type == HitType.SERIES:
    # prints s01e01's full description
    print(searches[0].get_seasons()[0].get_episodes()[0].full_description)

if searches[0].type == HitType.MOVIE:
    print(searches[0].length)  # returns in milliseconds
    print(searches[0].cast)
    print(searches[0].audio_tracks)
    print(searches[0].subtitles)

```

### More examples
```python
from pydisney import MovieType, SeriesType

# Search by program type
print(api.search_program_type(MovieType.ALL))
# or
print(api.search_program_type(SeriesType.KIDS))

```

### Downloading subtitles

```python
# by default download path is downloads/
api.set_download_path("custom/downloads")
search = api.search_movies("star wars")[0]
subs = search.subtitles
for sub in subs:
    if sub.language == "pl":
        sub.download(name="name")
```
### Downloading audio

```python
search = api.search_series("marvel")[0].get_seasons()[0].get_episodes()[0]
audios = search.audio_tracks
for audio in audios:
    if audio.language == "pl":
        audio.download(name="name", quality="max")  # allowed max or min, feel free to make a PR to add custom ones
```
