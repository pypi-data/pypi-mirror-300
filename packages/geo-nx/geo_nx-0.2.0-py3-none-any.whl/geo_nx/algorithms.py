    The node sets and edges sets do not need to be disjoint.

    ----------
    geo_g, geo_h : GeoGraph

    -------
    A new GeoGraph with the same type and crs as geo_g

    Notes
    -----
    The crs of geo_g and geo_h have to be identical.
    It is recommended that geo_g and geo_h be either both directed or both undirected.
