### Publishing

#### 1. Authenticate with PyPi

In order to publish, you will have to authenticate with pypi and your account must have permission to administer the strudel-cli package on pypi.

#### 2. Build a distrubtable package

```
rm -rf dist && python -m build
```

This will generate `.whl` and `.tar.gz` files in the `dist/` folder.

#### 3. Upload to (Test)PyPi

```
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
