In BioSamples, you can link different samples that you have submitted using the attributes `derived_from`, `same_as`, `has_member` and `child_of`. You can find more information on these relationship types in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/docs/guides/relationships. An important thing to remember about relationships is that they are **bi-directional**: That means, if you specify a type of relationship on sample A towards sample B, the inverse (or equal, in the case of `same_as`) will automatically apply on the sample\n",
    "\n",

    "The cooler answer is that I got this covered in `biobroker`! On the `BsdApi` object there is a keyword argument you can pass to the `submit` function, `process_relationships`, that when set to True, will do the trick for you so you just need to worry.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you've got the samples, you just need to update the metadata to include the relationship; for this, you can either:\n",
    "* Add the value for each of the samples retrieved in your script and update them using `BsdApi.update()`\n",
    "* Output the samples to a more user-friendly format (Xlsx, tsv) modify them, load them back and update them using `BsdApi.update()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata entities automatically recognise that the origin sample is accessioned, so when you add the relationship, it will be added to the proper metadata and you don't need to use the `process_relationships` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third, more complicated option, which is to specify them somewhat manually; there is a function, [`add_relationship`](https://biobroker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/biobroker.metadata_entity.html#biobroker.metadata_entity.Biosample.add_relationship) for which you can specify the relationship manually, but... I don't really think it's worth it. I made it really simple for the user!"

For a couple examples of structured data, you can look at this sample in production: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA112948612 or look at the [documentation examples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/docs/references/api/submit#_submit_structured_data)\n",
